Damn bruh, you know what I’m feeling like?

[HOOK]
Come ride on my wave bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Lights camera action when I pull up with that tool

You know I don’t play bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Got em starstruck; if I pull up then it’s news

Come ride on my wave bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Lights camera action when I pull up with that tool

You know I don’t play bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Got em starstruck; if I pull up then it’s news

[VERSE 1]
Pockets full of them blue faces; she gone buss it down
Live at the show, I’m on stage and I’m gone shut it down
I work too hard, fuck a vacation; I’m gone hold it down
I just roll it up, put it in rotation; this that Cali loud
I just need me a bad bitch; face like Kali, thicc like Dreezy
If she got that super head; imma fly her out to Fiji
Bless the bottle, make my wishes come true like a genie
Pop a tab & see the world in 3D
Never sleezy, I just make it look so easy *aye*
Fuck a hater, fuck the system; can’t fuck with my vision
Can’t fuck with my crew; we with the shits; Bad Boy Pistons
That boy Rucku$ got them hooks like he going fishing
Spitting game but they don’t wanna listen
They don’t wanna listen
But still they wanna

[HOOK]
Hop on my wave bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Lights camera action when I pull up with that tool

You know I don’t play bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Got em starstruck; if I pull up then it’s news

Come ride my wave bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Lights camera action when I pull up with that tool

You know I don’t play bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Got em starstruck; if I pull up then it’s news

[VERSE 2]
I’m a west coast vato; you know what I’m bout
They love me in the east coast & down south
Made my mark; ain’t no crossing me out
Been stacking my funds now they checking me out
I’m checking these clowns that running they mouth
Catch me on TV while you sleep on the couch
I am the plug, I smoke by the ounce
Play this in the whip, all you feel is the bounce
You popping on the gram but not in life
Hard to be genius; too much on my mind
Read between the lines
Villain Beach; I’m never switching sides
Blade on tuck; don’t need to fight
Paper boy; don’t need a bike
Glowing up; don’t need a light
Kill my vibe; I’ll end your night

[HOOK]
Come ride on my wave bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Lights camera action when I pull up with that tool

You know I don’t play bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Got em starstruck; if I pull up then it’s news

Come ride on my wave bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Lights camera action when I pull up with that tool

You know I don’t play bitch
I’m feeling like Tom Cruise
Got em starstruck; if I pull up then it’s news

[OUTRO]
Aye.. aye.. aye..aye..aye
Lil bitch!
