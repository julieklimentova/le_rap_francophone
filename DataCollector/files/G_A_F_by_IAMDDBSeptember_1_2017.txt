IAMDDB should have kept it G
Yeah yeah, I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck what you do, I get bitches too
Give a fuck what you like, I mix that lean with the dirty Sprite
Give a fuck, pull up, skrrt, I don't give it up
I don't forget where I'm from, nobody can do what I does

[Verse 1]
DDB with the dance moves, DDB with hot sauce
I pull up, I dip and I ride it, you kiss me, you gotta deny it
I'm not even leanin', I'm not even lonely
All the bitches they wanna know me
And your man hit my DM, he's comfy

[Chorus]
I don't get a fuck what you do, I get bitches too
Give a fuck what you like, mix that lean with the dirty Sprite
Give a fuck, pull up, skrrt, I don't give it up
I don't forget where I'm from, nobody can do what I does

[Verse 2]
Taking my time, yeah I'm taking it, I ain't in a rush
Taking my time, yeah I'm taking it, let it do what it does
I let it do what it does, yeah, you ain't part of my team, no
You don't know what this means, no, this is gold, this ain't free

[Bridge]
Pull up, skrrt, lemme take your bitch, fuck five
Would you pull up, skrrt, take your bitch, fuck five
Pull up, skrrt, lemme take your bitch, fuck five
Would you pull up, skrrt, take your bitch, fuck five

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck what you do, I get bitches too
Give a fuck what you like, I mix that lean with the dirty Sprite
Give a fuck, pull up, skrrt, I don't give it up
I don't forget where I'm from, nobody can do what I does

[Verse 3]
Yeah yeah, nobody can do what I does
If you ain't backing the team then forget it
'Cause you ain't part of my team no, oh oh
Yeah yeah, you don't know what this means now

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck what you do 'cause I get bitches too
Give a fuck what you like, I mix that lean with the dirty Sprite
Give a fuck, pull up, skrrt, I don't give it up
I don't forget where I'm from, nobody can do what I does
I don't give a fuck what you do I get bitches too
Give a fuck what you like, I mix that lean with the dirty Sprite
Give a fuck, pull up, skrrt, I don't give it up
I don't forget where I'm from, nobody can do what I does

[Refrain]
Nobody can do what I does
Nobody can do what I does
Nobody can do what I does
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck what you do, I get bitches too
Give a fuck what you like, I mix that lean with the dirty Sprite
Give a fuck, pull up, skrrt, I don't give it up
I don't forget where I'm from, nobody can do what I does
I don't give a fuck what you do, I get bitches too
Give a fuck what you like, I mix that lean with the dirty Sprite
Give a fuck, pull up, skrrt, I don't give it up
I don't forget where I'm from, nobody can do what I does
