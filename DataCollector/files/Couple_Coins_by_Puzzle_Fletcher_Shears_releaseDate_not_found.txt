As long as I can keep my nails
Old women think I'm funny
Cause I know what the hell I’m talking about
Mix it up, I love to flip
Couple coins, two sides to this
Coal mine, stay running shit
I make the wave, you're surfing it yeah

How am I suppose to follow this gps
When I don't even know where the hell I’m going

How am I suppose to follow this gps
When I don't even know where the hell I'm going


Why the hell you getting so chummy
I barely said more than 10 words
Bees are out making your honey
Your eggs are coming from a bird
Mix it up, I love to flip
Couple coins, two sides to this
Coal mine, stay running shit
I make the wave, you're surfing it yeah

How am I suppose to follow this gps
When I don't even know where the hell I'm going
