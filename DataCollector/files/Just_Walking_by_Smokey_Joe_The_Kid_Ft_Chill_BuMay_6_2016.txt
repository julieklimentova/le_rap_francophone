It's hard to cope with
My soft little heart is broken
I'm home alone like Macauly Culkin. Wake up every morning sulking waiting for the local bar to open
And I'm such a lazy mess
Waiting for death to end this crazy mess and put my pain to rest. Sometimes I reach out to the side of the bed but all I find is plenty empty vodka bottles instead

What we had was truly that unique; The school teacher, the musician, The beauty and the beast. But I was always on the road seeing dudes I had to meet, getting hammered after shows and having groupies at my feet. Its crazy! When all these ladies place you on a pedistal
Poke they little tiddies out and claim you are incredible. Stupidness loosed it with confidrnce I had when one day my baby caught me packing condoms in my bag

Yeah I just started drinking
To calm the tension
And not to mention stop me thinking
My body's stinkin'
And I get washed in a minute
I'll get evicted next month
But I dont wanna admit it
Shit
And I'm such a lazy mess waiting for death to end this crazy mess and put my pain to rest. Sometimes I reach out to the side of the bed but all I find is empty Heineken cans and bottles of red

I heard she was seeing a police office, I'm sure he's soft
Plus what more could he offer her?
I started stalking her
I confronted the man
He punched and pushed me and I plunged like the pussy drunk that I am
My honey was hollering "get up and then scram!"
Pity is all I feel
A dollar bill was scruntched in my hand
She left me like a helpless freak
But with no self esteem
Who's doom to dream about his powerlessness, rub one out and then cry himself to sleep
