          
            
            [Chorus]
Oh, I'd rather be kissing in summer, so innocent
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want

[Verse 1]
I smell like a rose, can I have you in doses?
No, I don't wanna fight, but I will if you like
I don't swim, I just dive right into those blue-green eyes
No, I don't wanna fight, I just, I just wanna be

[Chorus]
Kissing in summer, so innocent
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want

[Verse 2]
And da da da da da da
The sun in our eyes, this love is blind
Let's not decide whether we're too far gone
'Cause I'd rather be

[Chorus]
Kissing in summer, so innocent
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want (That's what I want)

[Outro]
Oh oh, oh, oh da-da-dumn
That's what I
Dum da-da-dum, oh
That's what I
