          
            
            [Verse 1]
Got a pack of cigarettes
25 in a deck
Don't you know this shit is not gonna solve your problems
Why don't you take a breath
Why don't we take a step closer to the edge, my dear
Don't you see my thoughts are drowning in the unclear

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a penny for your thoughts
I got a dollar for the doubts
I got a message for the lovers
I got a message for myself
I got a different point of view
Diving in the deep blue sky
See I found myself sitting there when I was getting high

[Chorus]
I'm on a permanent vacation to the soul
And I don't feel like working my
Fingers to the bone
And I fly like the bird
Above all of the bullshit
And I’m looking down on myself
To start all of the good shit
And I know, I know, I know it's coming my way
And I know, I know, I know it's coming my way

[Verse 2]
I know sometimes
When it’s raining down on me
And I wish that I could unsee somethings
That I didn’t wanna see, no
You're not gonna be the one to mould my ego, no no
I'd rather leave my bags at the door and let it all go

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a penny for my thoughts
I got a dollar for my doubts
I got a message for my lover
I got a message for myself
And don't you know I got a different point of view
Diving in the deep blue sky
See I
Found myself sitting there when I was getting high

[Chorus]
I'm on a permanent vacation to the soul
And I don't feel like working my
Fingers to the bone
And I fly like the bird
Above all of the bullshit
And I’m looking down on myself
To start all of the good shit
And I know, I know, I know it's coming my way
And I know, I know, I know it's coming my way
