          
            
            [Chorus] x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?

[Verse 1]
I ain't got time for your pussies
Time for them hoes
Even if I love the way you dance
I keep my circle close
Ain't no time for the critics
Tired of it all
Went from most loved to most hated without moving out of home
But fuck, I'm moving overseas
2018, NYC
They've been making fun of me
While I got meetings with JB
Getting out of my country
They were not ready for my shit
You want facts you gon' get them
So I'll be back with a Grammy

[Chorus] x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?

[Verse 2]
Paris with my brother So'
And we're meeting CEOs
Rilès international
Labels be blowing up my phone
Empire's starting to grow
Females come but never go
Reading contracts all night long
A hundred times just to make sure
Nobody's fooling the plan, imma write it my way
California this summer, nah I don't pay the tickets
Alright, alright, it's all good, don't talk 'bout what's secret
Imma finish Rilèsundayz then you gon see it
Silence and I were friends
Fireworks made us lose the bond
Darling I figured out
Peace wasn't made for me at all..

[Chorus] x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?

[Outro]
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Ain't that enough to remain in minds?
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Is that enough to remain in minds?
