When he ain't around and you feelin' down, lil' baby, just call on me
I know you soaking wet and I feel like drownin', baby, just call on me
She drippin' all on me
She got some water, it fall on me
My bitch been callin' me
But I'm in the back givin' all of me
I love when she talk to me
But I told lil' baby that talk is cheap
We fuck like we ain't talked in weeks
Fuckin' up all the sheets
I want that grizzly bear, keep all the teeth
I can't even lie, she a beast, hah
Been fuckin' with her, ain't been dealin' with me
I got a bitch but I'm feelin' her vibe
We gettin' busy, ain't wastin' no time
I fuck her good with no strings and no ties

[Chorus: Ann Marie & CalBoy]
Popped a Xan for the moment
Slap my ass, pull my hair, show you want it
Boy, you got a pussy lookin' like a faucet
Fuck that bitch that you with, she ain't on shit
I'm feelin' your vibe, and I know you feelin' mine, I get on top and just ride
Go down every time, uh, uh, uh, uh, let's keep this shit 'tween you and I
When she ain't around, I'm gon' make you drown
Know you like me better by the way I put it down
I'm gon' make you drown, when she ain't around
I know you like me better by the way I put it down
When he ain't around, when he ain't around
I know she like me better by the way I dick her down
When he ain't around, when he ain't around
I know you like me better by the way I pipe you down

[Verse 2: Ann Marie]
She ain't around and you feelin' down, baby, just call on me
Whenever you want it, you feelin' lonely, baby, just call on me
Want you to put that tongue all on me
This pussy so good, have you stalkin' me
I really don't do this but you got me choosin'
I'm ready to feel that dick all in me
From the moment that we met, knew you was somethin' special
And if you stick with her, then baby, you gon' settle
By the way you dick me down, boy, you deserve a medal
Wanna make sure that you hit that spot so I'ma help you, baby
Let's go all the way, let's go for round after round

[Chorus: Ann Marie & CalBoy]
Popped a Xan for the moment
Slap my ass, pull my hair, show you want it
Boy, you got a pussy lookin' like a faucet
Fuck that bitch that you with, she ain't on shit
I'm feelin' your vibe, and I know you feelin' mine, I get on top and just ride
Go down every time, uh, uh, uh, uh, let's keep this shit 'tween you and I
When she ain't around, I'm gon' make you drown
Know you like me better by the way I put it down
I'm gon' make you drown, when she ain't around
I know you like me better by the way I put it down
When he ain't around, when he ain't around
I know she like me better by the way I dick her down
When he ain't around, when he ain't around
I know you like me better by the way I pipe you down
