          
            
            [Verse 1]
I was gone in a minute, I'll be back in a moment
Four stars on my dash, 'cause my car is stolen
I've been down on my knees, but I'm never proposin'
Me and you got ghosts
I've been livin' at my mom's, but I'm definitely homeless
Five stars on the line 'cause I'm definitely chosen
Seein' silver in the lines, when this hour is golden
Me and you got ghosts

[Chorus]
Could I leave it without a trace?
Hot and cold 'til we slide away
We could just go
We could just go
And if you're comin', let me know
We could just go

[Verse 2]
I've been gone for a minute, now I'm back on the road
We had cracks in our pavement, never set in stone
Left alone, only see you at shows, and it shows
I've been down on my highs, I been up on my lows
In the wind, in the fire, I could never be cold
And the old saying goes
"If it shines, then it may not be gold"

[Chorus]
Could I leave it without a trace?
Hot and cold 'til we slide away
We could just go (Just go, baby we could just go)
We could just go (Just go, baby we could just go)
And if you're comin', let me know (Just go, baby we could just go)
We could just go
