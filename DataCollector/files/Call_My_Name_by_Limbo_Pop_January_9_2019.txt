          
            
            I can hear you call my name each time I go to sleep
I can hear you talk to me each I time
You're all I need
And though I don't think I have found
Love this way before
And though I've never felt like I
Have ever wanted more
I can feel you in my dreams
Your touch is lightning
I can see you in front of me
Your eyes are shining

And though I don't think I have found felt this way before
And though i never felt like I ever wanted more

I can hear you call my name each time I go to sleep
I can hear you talk to me each I time
You're all I need
And though I don't think i have found
Felt this way before
And though I never felt like I
Have ever wanted more
