          
            
            [Verse:]
Stayin' up all night
Everything's in black and white
But when I'm missin' you baby
Everything turns up on bright
Got me runnin' round in circles
Get me up and get me high
Don't know where you ran away
But I will try and find you

[Chorus:]
Cause when you
Are near me baby
I see
The world so clearly
And when you
Are far away
There ain't nothing
Left to say

[Verse:]
But I can't live without you
You were always on mind
And when I get you closer
All the stars are re-aligned
Just take a deep breath boy
Let's just unwind
Come along with me and then
It'll be alright

[Chorus:]
Cause when you
Are near me baby
I see
The world so clearly
And when you
Are far away
There ain't nothing
Left to say
