Uh huh
Bet you never leave
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Never
Uh huh
Bet you never, never leave
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Bet you never, no

[Verse 1]
Well you're wrapped up in a blanket
And you're staring at the floor
The conversation's moderated
By the noisy streets below
I never wanna hurt you, baby
I'm just a mess with a name and a price
And now I'm drunker than before they
Told me drinking doesn't make me nice

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know where some people will go
Yeah, some people been hurting me
You can tell by a look, by the slightest crook
In the neck, or the blink of an eye
Well then they'll say what they say
And they'll do what they do
But that doesn't mean a goddamn thing
You can listen if you want, you can listen if you don't
Yeah they'll talk, yeah they'll even sing

[Chorus]
Oh everybody now
Oh oh oh, oh, oh-oh
They come singing through the window, singing through the trees
Yeah, they're singing through the bright spring leaves
Everybody now
Oh oh oh, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, we love you and I need you
But someday you're gonna need to find some other kind of place to go, oh

[Intro]
Bet you never leave
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Never
Uh huh
Bet you never, never leave
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Bet you never, no

[Verse 2]
Now you're standing in the kitchen
And you're pouring out my drink
Well there's a very obvious difference
And it's that one of us can think
If there's a bump in the road, yeah you'd fix it
But for me, yeah I'll just run off the road
But tonight you've got me cornered
And I haven't got a place to go

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know where some people will go
Yeah, some people been hurting me
You can tell by a look, by the slightest crook
In the neck, or the blink of an eye
Well then they'll say what they say
And they'll do what they do
But that doesn't mean a goddamn thing
You can listen if you want, you can listen if you don't
Yeah they'll talk, yeah they'll even sing

[Chorus]
Oh everybody now
Oh oh oh, oh, oh-oh
They come singing through the window, singing through the trees
Yeah, they're singing through the bright spring leaves
Everybody now
Oh oh oh, oh, oh-oh (Sing it loud, sing it loud)
Yeah, they love you and I need you
But someday you're gonna need to find some other kind of place to go

[Outro]
Don't you know? (Oh oh oh, oh, oh-oh)
Don't wanna leave, you and me
Start talking 'bout other people
Oh oh oh, oh, oh-oh
