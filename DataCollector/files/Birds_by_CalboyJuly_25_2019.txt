Feel me 'cause I paint a picture with these words
Pancho 
I  know these bitches feel me 'cause I paint a picture with these words
Paint a picture with these words
Bitch, I paint a picture with these
Uh,  uh, gang, hey

[Chorus]
I  know 'bout some pain so I just been hidin' feelings with the syrup
I know these bitches feel me 'cause I paint a picture with these words
I'm  with the killers that kill all the killers, but fuck what you heard
That bitch be callin', but I never pick up, she get on my nerves
I keep a 30, ain't talkin' no Percs, bitch, I be drippin' and fly like a bird
I'm in the trap with them members, the members, the dealers, they be whippin' and flippin' the birds
Get  in my feelings and wrote out some nerves, all that sneak dissin' gon' get that boy hurt
Said I was the talk of the streets, I heard, we'll send shots, bullets burn like Percs

[Verse]
Jump out the whip, I'm with the gang, we turnt up the VIP
Bitch, I ain't lackin', this Glock on my hip, ain't talkin' movies, but we got the clips
Hey, I brought the demons in here, I done got through with my nina in here
Bitch, pray to your God, you need him in here, he get to tweakin', we leavin' him here
Fuck what you heard, got it out the motherfuckin' dirt, ayy
Make a bitch jump out her skirt, ayy, bitch, I'm too good with these words, yeah, ayy
I'm off the Perc, ayy, bitch, I'm too high off this earth
I poured a 4 of the syrup, ayy, he play with me and get murked, ah, ayy

[Chorus]
I know 'bout some pain so I just been hidin' feelings with the syrup
I know these bitches feel me 'cause I paint a picture with these words
I'm with the killers that kill all the killers, but fuck what you heard
That bitch be callin', but I never pick up, she get on my nerves
I keep a 30, ain't talkin' no Percs, bitch, I be drippin' and fly like a bird
I'm in the trap with them members, the members, the dealers, they be whippin' and flippin' the birds
Get in my feelings and wrote out some nerves, all that sneak dissin' gon' get that boy hurt
Said I was the talk of the streets, I heard, we'll send shots, bullets burn like Percs
