Yeah, ah‚ yeah‚ ah
Yeah‚ ah, eh
Ah, aye‚ oh no no
Stick, aye

[Verse 1: BamSavage]
I need a perc
My feelings hurt
Missing my niggas
That are dead in the dirt
Selling that foo
Like is dessert
Lean In my tummy
That shit makes me burp
She wanna fuck
I don't even flirt
You wanna play
Lets play till you squirt
I'm trapping weed
She's trapping pussy
She go to work
That shit really works
I pray to god I don't get hurt
On my mama wearing me on a shirt
I ain't going out I keep a Tully
Got me fucked up I ain't dying by jewelry
Whole gun gonna rob a community
Bust in your crib like a scene of a movie
Those are my friends I don't let them consume me
Fuck the label tell them cracker come sue me

[Verse 2: Hypno Carlito]
She want my time
I want some money
I fuck that bitch
Then pass it to my homies
This niggas be lying
This niggas be funny
Till my tea make them head
Pop like a bunny
I come from the block
But I ended up in London
Young niggas made something from nothing
