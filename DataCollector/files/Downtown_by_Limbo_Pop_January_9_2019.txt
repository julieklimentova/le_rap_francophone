          
            
            It's getting cold in the city
I remember when you called me pretty
I thought we had it easy
And then it all changed just like the fall leaves
I want to hold you close to me
Forget when you first left me
I feel lost and miss you baby
Please come home and kiss me dearly

Every time you come around on my mind
I'll be on that up and down
All the time
Every time you come around
I'll be fine
I just wanna go down town
That's a Lie

Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown

I am oh so sorry
Now you are just a memory
I am oh so sorry
Now you are just a memory

Every time you come around on my mind
I'll be on that up and down
All the time
Every time you come around
I'll be fine
I just wanna go down town
That's a Lie

Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
Downtown
