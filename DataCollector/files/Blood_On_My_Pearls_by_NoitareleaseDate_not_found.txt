          
            
            I was on the run searching for the sun
I guess that’s how I feel

You left me here alone now I’m a loaded gun
That’s how you make me feel

I got blood on my pearls, no Dior
I got honey drip drip and it’s pure
I got blood on my pearls, no Dior

Say you’ll stay
Promise me you’ll wait another day
Boy I’ll pray
Promise you there is no other way

I got blood on my pearls, no Dior
I got honey drip drip and it’s pure
I got blood on my pearls, no Dior

Hours in the dark
Sipping on the rock
I guess that’s what I needed
You’re sweet like suicide
I wanna feel alive
But I can’t keep the deal

I got blood on my pearls, no Dior
I got honey drip drip and it’s pure
I got blood on my pearls, no Dior

Say you’ll stay
Promise me you’ll wait another day
Boy I’ll pray
Promise you there is no other way

I got blood on my pearls, no Dior
I got honey drip drip and it’s pure
I got blood on my pearls, no Dior

So I hold you up to the light baby boy cause you’re my star shine
And I hold you close to my heart in the night cus you’re my lifeline

So I hold you up to the light baby boy cause you’re my star shine
And I hold you close to my heart in the night cus you’re my lifeline

Blood on my pearls
I got honey drip drip, drip drip
Blood on my pearls
I got honey drip drip, drip drip
