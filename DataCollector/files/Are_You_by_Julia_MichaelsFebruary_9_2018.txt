          
            
            [Verse 1]
Hold onto my heartbeat like you mean it
'Cause there's something too real to let it slide
If you gotta go, we can achieve it
You better believe it, so do I
I don't need your words to get me goin'
Let your body language set the tone
Save all your emotions for the motion
Don't make me go at this alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Up and down in your direction
I keep lookin'
Up and down in your direction
And I feel you watchin' too

[Chorus]
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Are you openin' doors to your feelings?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Ooh, it's gettin' so hot in here, ooh
I keep makin' it crystal clear, ooh
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?

[Verse 2]
I'll lasso you into my dimension
You'll pull me into your universe
Let's see who can handle all the tension
Who's getting it first? Mmm...

[Pre-Chorus]
Up and down in your direction
I keep lookin'
Up and down in your direction
And I feel you watchin' too

[Chorus]
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Are you openin' doors to your feelings?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Ooh, it's gettin' so hot in here, ooh
I keep makin' it crystal clear, ooh
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?

[Bridge]
Now I wanna try somethin'
My subconscious goes
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (haha, yeah)
And yours goes
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (I like that)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (all together) (okay)
Ooh!

[Chorus]
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Are you openin' doors to your feelings?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Ooh, it's gettin' so hot in here, ooh (gettin' so hot)
I keep makin' it crystal clear, ooh (keep makin' it)
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
