          
            
            [Verse 1]
I think I'm past the point of calling you a bad habit
Ain't trying to get no sympathy, oh, sounds tragic
But it's hard for me to hide your side effects from showing
You strike the match and I burn the lanterns, embers glowing

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you

[Verse 2]
I got a couple hit or miss tricks that I use for distraction
But as soon I slow down and I start flash-backing
To the night before when I was buzzing harder than that storefront neon
Yeah, if your kiss gets me this high, oh I wouldn't mind just keep on

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you

[Bridge]
Need a little rush from your touch
Little late night pick me up
When you make me come unwound
Why I can't put you down
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain smokin' you
No, no, no, no
