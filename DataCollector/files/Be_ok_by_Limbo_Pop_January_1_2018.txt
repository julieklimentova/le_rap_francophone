          
            
            Oh this Life, is so weird, and I'm so scared
Who am I
Who are you
Why are we here
I'm so confused
And so are you
Can we all please, just hug it out

All the day, pass on by, like they're nothin'
I feel like, I have to, offer something
Is this a game or something lame
Like a simulation, we're all the same

Heh we're all the same
Heh it's in our brains
Heh we're all the same
So lets just be ok

Starting wars, causing fights like it helps us
Who am I to talk politics it's unjust
I'm just a girl in a strange world
Feeling like I, am too straight, in all of the curves

Oh my God aren't we all just people
Going through space like a Star Trek sequel
This Is unreal, so surreal, like a simulation were all the same

Heh we're all the same
Heh it's in our brains
Heh we're all the same
So lets just be OK

Heh we're all the same
Heh it's in our brains
Heh we're all the same
So lets just be OK
