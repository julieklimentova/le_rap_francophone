Yeah yeah, ayy
Yeah yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I am fucking tripping, girl, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
I just want to love you but the drugs enter my mind
I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to waste your time
I can't feel no love, shawty, I already died
I already died, I cannot feel a thing inside
I'm gon' fuck you, girl, and put my feelings to the side (Yeah, yeah)
I'm gon' tell you straight up so there's nothing I can hide
And it's okay to cry because it is the truth, no lie, yeah

[Verse 1]
I came from the bottom (Skeet)
Two bitches they on me, they just want my commas
If you got a problem
We bust at your mama, we shooting, no drama
Sippin' that muddy
Two bitches, they on me, don't care if they love me
Just want my money
I look at that bitch, I'm like, "Girl, don't tell me"
Girl, don't tell me
Look at that ho, I'm like, "Girl, don't tell me"
Sippin' that lean
Sippin' that lean, bitch, that lean in my tummy
Yeah, this Bam
Over this shit and you just want my money
Rap off the dome
Fucked a lil' bitch and I sent that bitch home

[Chorus]
I am fucking tripping, girl, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
I just want to love you but the drugs enter my mind
I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to waste your time
I can't feel no love, shawty, I already died
I already died, I cannot feel a thing inside
I'm gon' fuck you, girl, and put my feelings to the side
I'm gon' tell you straight up so there's nothing I can hide
And it's okay to cry because it is the truth, no lie, yeah

[Verse 2]
I fucked a bitch just to get in her crib
Wait 'til she sleep then I sneak in her fridge
Her parents are gone so I wanted these scripts
I had to do this shit all on my own
I fucked a bitch just to sleep in her home
I had to turn my best friend to the chrome
Hitting these licks and we'll never go home
Sorry Mama, I ain't answer the phone
I was busy serving, counting this dough
Feeling codeine crazy, I poured a four
Ten rolls around my neck and they all gold
Yes, it is Bam, bitch, I will take your soul
Ridin' around with my niggas, we hitting
Yes, it is Bam, bitch my guns, they gon' spit it
Ayy, yeah
Yes, it is Bam, bitch my guns, they gon' spit it

[Chorus]
I am fucking tripping, girl, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
I just want to love you but the drugs enter my mind
I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to waste your time
I can't feel no love, shawty, I already died
I already died, cannot feel a thing inside
I'm gon' fuck you, girl, and put my feelings to the side
I'm will tell you straight up so there's nothing I can hide
And it's okay to cry because it is the truth, no lie, yeah

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, realest shit I ever spoke
Ayy, ayy, diamonds on me and they cold
