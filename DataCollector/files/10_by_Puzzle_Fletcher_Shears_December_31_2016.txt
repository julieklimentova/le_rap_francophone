          
            
            [Verse 1]
Everything we make is to the debt collector
Still outside the box though
And not defective
Like a windshield wiper
You're on beat
Then you're off again
Then you're off again
Everything we make is to the debt collector
Still outside the box though
And not defective
Like a windshield wiper
You're on beat
Then you're off again
Then you're off again

[Chorus]
Climb the mountain
Thinking it's the last one
Taste the fresh air
Now there's 10 ahead of ya
Climb the mountain
Thinking it's the last one
Taste the fresh air
Now there's 10 ahead of ya, ya
Now there's 10 ahead of ya

[Verse 2]
Hit the open air
Haven't been out
Can't say you saw me
Been behind a window
Sitting here it's
Gonna be a
Haven't seen ya
In a while sorta
Type of year
Crossing out fear
Haven't heard of that word
Jumping into chapter 5
Away from the heard
You don't like this
Well it's never heard of you
Fools like to talk
With their eyes shut too

[Chorus]
Climb the mountain
Thinking it's the last one
Taste the fresh air
Now there's 10 ahead of ya
Climb the mountain
Thinking it's the last one
Taste the fresh air
Now there's 10 ahead of ya, ya
Now there's 10 ahead of ya

Now there's 10 ahead of ya
