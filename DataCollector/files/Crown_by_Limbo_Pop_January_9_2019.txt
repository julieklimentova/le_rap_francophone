          
            
            Oh yeah we on a roll
Don't wanna hear you call me adorable
And I am on the ball
Or I get it don’t take no adderall
And oh life's wonderful
Sitting on the sidelines enjoy it all
And I don't wanna fall
No way I will when I’m standing this tall

And I don't want to see you around
And you act like you don't see my crown
I don't want to see you around
You act like you don't see my crown
I don't want to see you around
You act like you don't see my crown
I don't want to see you around
You act like you don’t see my crown

Oh yeah here I go again
Got my numbers up like 1 to 10
Oh and you wanna doubt
Come back around till you chase this clout
And oh you have it wrong
Takes more than cash to make a good song
And I know its effect
You need me like I’m the toe to your tic tac

I don't want to see you around
You act like you don’t see my crown
I don't want to see you around
You act like you don't see my crown
I don't want to see you around
You act like you don’t see my crown
I don't want to see you around
You act like you don't

You don't
You don't

You don't
You don't

You don't
You don't
