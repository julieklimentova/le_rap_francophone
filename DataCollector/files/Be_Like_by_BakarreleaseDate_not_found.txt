[Chorus]
(I don't wanna be like, I don't wanna be like)
I never wanna be like

[Verse]
I found the reason
I've been smokin' so much, I've been feelin' so numb
Long time in the [?]
I ain't usin' my lungs, I ain't breathin', not much
Long time since you went away (Yeah)
Left me feelin' like a throwaway
Mum saw me, said, "BK, are you okay?"
She said, "BK, are you okay?"
She thinks you're the reason

[Refrain]
I don't wanna be like
You when I grow up, no
I went through the seaside
But you never showed love, no
I don't wanna be like
You when I grow up, no
I went through the seaside
But you never showed love, no

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be like (Ah, ah)
(Don't wanna be like)
I never wanna be like (Ah, ah, ah)
(Don't wanna be like)
I never wanna be like (Ah, ah)
(I don't wanna be like, I never wanna be like)
I never wanna be like (Ah, ah)
(I don't wanna be like, I don't wanna be like)
I never wanna be like

[Refrain]
I don't wanna be like
You when I grow up, no
I went through the seaside (Side, side)
But you never showed love, no
I don't wanna be like (Like, like)
You when I grow up, no
I went through the seaside (Side, side)
But you never showed love, no

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be like (Ah, ah)
(I don't wanna be like, never wanna be like)
I never wanna be like (Ah, ah, ah)
(I don't wanna be like, never wanna be like)
I never wanna be like (Ah, ah)
(I don't wanna be like, I never wanna be like)
I never wanna be like (Ah, ah)
(I don't wanna be like, I don't wanna be like)
I never wanna be like

[Outro]
I don't wanna be like you, no
Never wanna be like
I don't wanna be like you, no
Never wanna be like
I don't wanna be like you, no
Never wanna be like
I don't wanna be like you, no
Never wanna be like
