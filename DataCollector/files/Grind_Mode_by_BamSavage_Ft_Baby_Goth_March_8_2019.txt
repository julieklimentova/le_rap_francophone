          
            
            [Chorus: BamSavage]
Told that bitch I'm BamSavage, don't trip on me
I'm ridin' with my niggas, yeah, you know when we deep
I'm off more of the Perky, drop that Xan' in my lean
When I fuck your bitch I pass her off to the team
Got so many diamonds in my mouth I can't even speak
I be fuckin' on the bitch, I got a new one this week
Lot of new ones this week, I be pimpin' these hoes
Popped a tag on my clothes, fucked a bitch at the show

[Verse 1: BamSavage]
If I had them Xannies would you cancel all your plans?
If I had them bands would you change up on your mans?
If I had a 'Rari would you fuck me in my whip?
If I had that Aston would you go and take a trip?
Girl, can't have them, last one to attract ho
I fuck the bitch at the bando, I fuck the bitch with her friends, though
Uh, Gucci down to my socks
I might fuck that bitch drop top
I might do them drugs for a trend
You know I need my fuckin' meds
Every time I don't pick up, you be textin' shit
Uh, but you know I don't wanna hear that shit
Every time I don't pick up, you be textin' shit
Every time I'm in the 'Rari, I'ma flex and shit
Every time I'm with your bitch, I be fuckin' shit
Yeah, you know I smashed, shawty had me runnin' shit

[Chorus: BamSavage]
Told that bitch I'm BamSavage, don't trip on me
I'm ridin' with my niggas, yeah, you know when we deep
Gucci down to my socks
I might fuck that bitch drop top
Got so many diamonds in my mouth I can't even speak
I be fuckin' on the bitch, I got a new one this week
Uh, Gucci down to my socks
I might fuck that bitch drop top

[Verse 2: Baby Goth]
I got a brand new car every day of the week
Posted flexin' on the 'Gram, they just flock to the scene
Drop top and we creep through the block
Pink rocks on my wrist, pink drink in my cup
True it right now, all my bitches iced out
Grew up in a small town, got my mama bust down
I flexed up, all my homies are the plugs
We smoke up, got exclusive in our lungs
Let me dance for you, I like it when they stare
I can change your mood in my Gucci underwear
Movin' like the diamonds on your neck, aura bright like VVS
Super soaker, got me wet, designer on me in the jet

[Chorus: BamSavage]
Told that bitch I'm BamSavage, don't trip on me
I'm ridin' with my niggas, yeah, you know when we deep
I'm off more of the Perky, drop that Xan' in my lean
When I fuck your bitch I pass her off to the team
Got so many diamonds in my mouth I can't even speak
I be fuckin' on the bitch, I got a new one this week
Lot of new ones this week, I be pimpin' these hoes
Popped a tag on my clothes, fucked a bitch at the show
