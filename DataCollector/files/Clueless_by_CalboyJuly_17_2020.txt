          
            
            [Chorus]
Clueless
I never knew about love
I never knew about love, oh
(Kash, turn me up a little bit)
Clueless
They never knew who he was
They never knew who he was, oh

[Verse 1]
I never knew about love
I never knew I'd be aching
They never knew who he was (Was)
They never knew 'bout the base (Base)
I thought I had me a baddie
I never knew she was basic
I spent all night in the trap (Skrrt, skrrt)
They never knew it wasn't vacant (Skrrt, skrrt)
I said it's back to the basics
I said fuck it, it's back to the basics (Back to the basics)
They never knew I could make it
Made a mil', how I carry my cadence
I done found me a plug out in Vegas
Watch him beat down the pot with the baby
In the kitchen with pies like the baker
And that bitch buggin' me like cicada
I said fuck it, let's get to some paper
I said fuck it, let's get to some paper (Get to some paper)
Heard the Bible say love all your neighbors (Love all your neighbors)
40 kiss 'em, goodnight, see you later
Body peek out the water like gator
Got a new Gucci suit and some gators
And that bitch double-R, I'm a player
Baby, don't fall in love, I'ma play ya

[Chorus]
Clueless
I never knew about love
I never knew about love, oh
Clueless
They never knew who he was
They never knew who he was, oh
Clueless
I never knew about love
I never knew about love, oh
Clueless
They never knew who he was
They never knew who he was, oh

[Verse 2]
They never knew what we did
You never knew what was done
Mama ain't know we had drugs (Drugs)
Grandma ain't know we had guns
I keep that pipe when I ride
Tweek in the streets and I bust
Percocet, it be beatin' me up
Fuck that bitch right to sleep when I'm done
They never knew I was savage
They never know how I'm coming, ayy
They never knew that I popped at them niggas for fucking around with my brother
He never knew that I had the lil' pipe on me, I be slicker than butter
40 go boom-boom-boom-boom, fire make that bitch duck
Had to scrape up my plate through the mud
Seen my bro with a face full of blood
Go to sleep, he keep waking me up
Medication, I'm taking too much
Told that bitch, girl, you lame as the fuck
What the fuck is you taking me for?
Fighting demons, they shaking me up
Pour up lean and I'm shaking it up

[Chorus]
Clueless
I never knew about love
I never knew about love, oh
Clueless
They never knew who he was
They never knew who he was, oh
Clueless
I never knew about love
I never knew about love, oh
Clueless
They never knew who he was
They never knew who he was, oh
