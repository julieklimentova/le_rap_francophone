          
            
            Hide in the grass
Whole amount of love to the task
Where we smoke again
Over knocked out fast

Over night my body
Turn a top
Turn a top
Over night my guidance
Turns a coal rider

Body

Body

Over my dead body
To the mop
To the mop
Over my dead body
Through the clock
Over the task, all to do a matador mask
Wait in the path
Where we smoke again fast

Over night my lighting
Whole amount of love to the task
Whole amount of love to the task
Whole amount of love to the task
Whole amount of love to the task

Over my dead body
Through the rock
Through the clock
Over your dead body
Wanna live again
Wanna live again
Keep on living then

Body

Over mind no matter
With a mock
With a mock
Over laid my time
To the mop
To the mop
Over night my body
Turn the lock
Turn the lock
Silver lite my miser

Clover thy lie silent
To the cop
To the crop
Over lite my martyr
Oh my mindâ€™s all mine

Over my dead body
Through the clock
Through the clock
There's a way to go
There's a way to go

Over mind no matter
With a mock
With a mock
Over laid my time
To the -my body
Over night my body
Turn the lock
Turn the lock
Over night my body
Oh my body oh my

Over my dead body
Through the clock
Through the clock
Through the clock
Through the clock
There's a way to go

Over my dead
Over mind no matter

Over my
Over my
