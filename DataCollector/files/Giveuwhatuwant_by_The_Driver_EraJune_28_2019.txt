          
            
            [Verse 1]
Can't stop in the morning
Gonna wake all the others up
Touch me in the morning
As we wait for the sun to come up

[Pre-Chorus]
We in the bad things
'Cause good things end sadly
And we live fast so we don't die slow
We both know these feelings
They won't last forever
But I'll surrender everything

[Chorus]
I'll give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need (Give me what I need)
I'll give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need
I'll surrender everything
It's what I need
Everything, yeah

[Verse 2]
The clothes on your body
Got no use for them anymore
You shine like a diamond
Even with the lights low
No one's ever told you before

[Pre-Chorus]
We in the bad things
'Cause good things end sadly
And we live fast so we don't die slow
We both know these feelings
They won't last forever
But I'll surrender everything

[Chorus]
I'll give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need (Give me what I need)
I'll give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need
I'll surrender everything
It's what I need
Everything
It's what I need
Give me what I need

[Bridge]
Can't stop
Touch me

[Pre-Chorus]
We in the bad things
'Cause good things end sadly
We live fast so we don't die slow
We both know these feelings
They won't last forever
But I'll surrender everything

[Chorus]
I'll give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need (Give me what I need)
I'll give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need
I'll surrender everything
Give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need (Give me what I need)
I'll give you what you want (Give you what you want)
If you give me what I need
I'll surrender everything
It's what I need
Everything
It's what I need
Give me what I need
