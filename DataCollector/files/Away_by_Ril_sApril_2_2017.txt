          
            
            [Verse 1]
Bitch niggas saying it's luck
But I which I got some
Spending all my money but that shit don't work
Tell me what I've done wrong
Trying to record all my thoughts but that shit so slow
Damn..
The fuck I did wrong?
Everything was fine but, nope, again
You're sending me another gigantic golden stick in the wheel
You see the fight but you can't see the struggle behind the scene
If only you knew how much pain is hidden behind your screen
Ay man, I'm not rapping for you to be all worried 'bout me
But Honesty and melodies are really all I can give
You see my hope, down
Slow, nah
Kemosabes try to lift me up, you down
You can tear me down everyday you fucking cunt
Hello problems let me tell you something you don't really want
I know that..

[Chorus]
One day you'll go away
One day you'll go away
One day you'll go away
Before I go away

[Bridge]
I'm sorry if you hear some popping noise sometimes in the recording
I just bought that new computer with all my savings and that shit's not working properly
It keeps on crashing
I lost like.. 40 dope-ass beat sessions
Lot of recordings
Mom's turning deaf too
But at least I can make beats in the A.M

[Verse 2]
Friends on the phone told me "Trust the maktub"
Can the maktub fuck up its rendez-vous?
Shut up man, bad luck's already on you
Walk on black cat under ladders while you're
Breaking mirrors, 13 'brellas in stud
Trust your feelings, flair the fakers' parfum
Don't get fooled by clovers luck is not true
Me, myself and I's always the best crew, ouhh
God gave me sundays
To fuck up the game
You can't ignore the name
R-I-L-Ãˆ-S
Forget the accent
Zinedinening your face
God gave me sundays
To fuck up the game
You can't avoid the flames
My head's in a mess
Still doing my best
Just cuz I know that

[Chorus]
One day you'll go away
One day you'll go away
One day you'll go away
Before I go away

[Outro]
Run
You better run
