          
            
            [Verse 1]
Red lips
You're ten a penny, cheap shot
Spreading your legs for the boys
Watch out
'Cause someone will beat you the same
Freak out
Hmm, wash out your mouth

[Chorus]
Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up, if you like it or not
What a shock

[Verse 2]
Little bitch
Growing so bored of your fits
'Cause sooner or later, you're down
Hang out with the worms
And no one remembers your name
Too bad
Hmm, such an inconsequence

[Chorus]
Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up, if you like it or not
Your number is up, if you like it or not

[Bridge]
Take a walk
Take a walk
What a shock
Take a walk, a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Little bitch, spreading your legs for the boys
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk

[Chorus]
Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up, if you like it or not
Your number is up, if you like it or not
Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up, if you like it or not
Your number is up, if you like it or not
Your number is up, if you like it or not
What a shock
