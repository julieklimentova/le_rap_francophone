I think my best friend thinks I've changed
Can't hack that we are not the same
Life just put us in different lanes
Truth is I love him all the same
I think my ex just wants to talk
Her worst fear is to be ignored
Saw you with him and you looked bored
No going back, our love is tortured
I think my mum just wants some space
Camden Town, we was bored and raised
Single mum, she was never fazed
Wonder if she misses him the same
I think that Yamta saw the vision
Since he passed, we've been on a mission
Stop drinking lean, I wish she'd listen
He believed in us, it was written

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)

[Verse 2]
Do my insecurities make you secure?
'Cause I'm on my way home, still not sure
If he's mad at me, did I cross the line?
I'm sure it's fine, but if not what's-, oh
Do my insecurities make you secure?
'Cause I'm on my way home, still not sure
If he's mad at me, did I cross the line?
I'm sure it's fine, but what's the cure?
I had her once, but now she's yours
Be proud, show off, 'cause now she's yours
She was born to ride but I missed the cause, round of applause
She's yours, she's yours, she's yours, she's yours
Treat her like a queen, 'cause now she's yours
Happened naturally, this was not forced
I'm not a casualty, this ain't a war, round of applause
She's yours, she's yours, she's yours, she's yours

[Bridge]
Hope it don't affect us
You know you're the best bruv
Always is all love
See you at ball, bruv
Hope it don't affect us
You know you're the best bruv
Always is all love
See you at ball, bruv

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)
I just want the best for you, and I know
That deep down you want the best for me (For me, for me)

[Outro]
(For me, for me)
