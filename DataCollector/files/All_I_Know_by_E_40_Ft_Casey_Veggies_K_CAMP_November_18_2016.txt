          
            
            [Chorus:  K Camp & Casey Veggies]
Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yo, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
That's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know

[Verse 1:  E-40]
Put the mackin' in action, mulah in motion
Pull up on the ave', mashin' and yokin'
Only thing in my wallet, my ID and a Trojan
Nigga-rich negro, pockets swollin'
Kingpin, bitch, I ain't talkin' 'bout bowlin'
Big boy shit, pistol totin'
Custom fit, exclusive clothing
Iceman Nick, jewelry frozen
Better tighten up on your broad, 'cause she loose (Loose)
Not a caped crusader, I don't spin around in phone booths
(Phone booths)
She want me to save her, all I wanted to do was goose (Goose)
Professor Xavier, I'm in her mind, I got the juice
Congratulator, not a hater, I'm higher than Space Invader
Your bitch, she want me to lay her, I told her, "Not now, later"
She thinkin' I wanna taste her, she think that I like her flavor
I'll dig her out like a crater then break the bitch for her paper
BIATCH!

[Chorus:  K Camp & Casey Veggies + (E-40)]
Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yeah, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know (That's all I know)
That's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know (That's all I know)

[Verse 2:  K Camp]
I can't trust a bitch, I apologize (Tell 'em)
My last slut, made my ass realize (What she do?)
She'd try to fuck for some Nobu
A bitch ain't worth a box of french fries (Ooh)
Kept me in the cut with some real guys (Guys)
Hypnotized by the bad bitch with thick thighs
40 said she a ghost so I gotta slide (Skrrt)
It's 4:30 AM, meet me at 5 (Pull up)
Take it to the car though, pour a couple drinks (Drinks)
Only thing I like between your legs is that pink (Pink)
And I ain't tryin' to penetrate if the shit stink
Don't touch the shower bitch, you can use the sink
Got love for the Bay and they love the boy too
Freaks at the 'tel tryin' to fuck the whole crew
O.G. on me, O.G., what it do?
Get my nut off and kick her out like ooooh

[Chorus:  K Camp & Casey Veggies + (E-40)]
Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yeah, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know (That's all I know)
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know (That's all I know)

[Verse 3:  Casey Veggies]
Oh man, bet that money make her to a backflip
Hundred bands stashed in the mattress
Got four hoes like I did a hat trick
But I told those girls "poof" I need a bad bitch
She play a role, actress
Like Taraji, she a boss chick
Kill the game, I don't take too many losses
All I know is green like I'm playin' out in Boston
Out in L.A. don't be doin' all that flossin'
'Cause they'll snatch the chain, probably sell it at the auction
Ballin' in the city like J. Clarkson
You fuck with hoes who choose up hella often
You say she bad, well, I don't think she flawless
Saks Fifth, I don't really do the mall shit
Stop playin', got your chick up on my call list
She don't just want me, I think she want the whole clique

[Chorus:  K Camp & Casey Veggies + (E-40)]
Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yeah, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know (That's all I know)
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know (That's all I know)
