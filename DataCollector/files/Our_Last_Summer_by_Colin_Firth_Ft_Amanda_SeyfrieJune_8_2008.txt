          
            
            [HARRY/COLIN FIRTH]
I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower

[SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN]
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH, SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN, & BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD]
Oh, yes

[BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD]
Those crazy years
That was the time of the flower-power

[SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN]
But underneath
We had a fear of flying

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH]
Of growing old
A fear of slowly dying

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH, SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN, & BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD]
We took our chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH, SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN, BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD, & FEMALE COMPANY]
Our last summer

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH, SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN, & BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD]
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH, SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN, BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD, & FEMALE COMPANY]
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

[SOPHIE/AMANDA SEYFRIED]
And now you're working in a bank
A family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH]
How dull it seems

[SOPHIE/AMANDA SEYFRIED]
Are you the hero of my dreams?

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH, SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN, BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD, & FEMALE COMPANY]
I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

I can still recall
Our last summer

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH, SAM/PIERCE BROSNAN, BILL/STELLAN SKARSGÅRD, DONNA/MERYL STREEP, & FEMALE COMPANY]
I still see it all

[HARRY/COLIN FIRTH & DONNA/MERYL STREEP]
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
