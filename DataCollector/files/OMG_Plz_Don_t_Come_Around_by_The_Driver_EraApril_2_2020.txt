(Oh my God)
(Oh my God)

[Verse 1]
I’m addled up
'Cause you make me so damn confused
I'm out of luck
Spent it all up on loving you, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I heard you’re a liar
Telephone wire
Tryna decipher
Maybe pariah
Maybe I like ya
Maybe I'll write but
She like Mariah
But 3 octaves higher
Overproof diet
Then we retired
Lost the attire
Era The Driver

[Chorus]
Yeah, you go around and you hold me like that
And I couldn't help but love you right back
Then you go around and you touch him like that
I won't trust you like that
You make me feel bad

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh my God
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh my God

[Verse 2]
We get along
Getting off in this hotel room
How much longer do I have to wait
Get over here next to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Low in a Hyatt
Tryna get higher
Look for the lighter
Neighborhood hire
Now the supplier
What’s with the people
Tryna go whiter
What the fuck
Children are dying
Moms at home cryin'
Fuck, now I’m cryin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, you come around and you hold me like that
And I couldn’t help but love you right back
Then you go around and you fuck him like that
I won’t trust you like that
You make me feel bad

[Post-Chorus]
So, go, go, go
(Wait one second, Ryland)
So, go, go, go
(Let me do it one more)
So, go, go, go
So, go, go, go
