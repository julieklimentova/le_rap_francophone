I don't really like to ask for a hand
I remember when she used to ask for mine
Nowadays she can't even find the time
To drop me a line
Drop me a line
Hey ya know, it's okay
I realise that I can't live this way
All the best to her and them
I'll always be here to extend my hand
I don't really like to ask for a hand
I remember when she used to ask for mine
Nowadays she can't even find the time
To drop me a line
Drop me a line
Hey ya know, it's okay
I realise that I can't live this way
All the best to her and them
I'll always be here to extend my hand
I'll always be here to extend my hand
I'll always be here to extend my hand
I'll always be here to extend my hand
Yeah

[Fat Tony]
Yeah these things take time
Heard I'm on your mind
Yeah you're on my mind too
Heard it through the grapevine
You don't wanna waste time
Hurry I don't waste none too
Maybe if we take time
Talk it out away from everyone
We know we'll be cool
Anything you need I'll be the one you could dial
Hope I can dial you too
Don't know what to do when you're here
Used to act a fool
Now I play it cool
When I'm ready for you
Started as a friendship
We don't gotta end it
You and me got someone new
Ain't looking to go backwards
Glad we ain't at war
I ain't gonna act up
And if we on the same page
We can keep it patched up
