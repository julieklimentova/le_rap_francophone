I filled the bucket
I spilled the bucket
Out on the floor
A mistake for sure

Consequences
Turned me hostile
I got so tied in
Made me docile

Then you applauded
When I was loving
Made me feel weak and
I start recovering

Now I feel silly
Selfish and dizzy
Now I got this feeling
That you'll forgive me

[Hook]
And you know
Oh my God, just please don't ever let me go
Yeah, sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me

[Verse 2]
That was the night we
Kissed in the moonlight
It was romantic
But didn't feel so right

Cause something was lost then
Today it's replenished
But it was you who
Cleaned up my messes

[Hook 2] (x2)
And oh
Oh my God, just please don't ever let me go
Yeah, sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me

(x4)
Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

[Verse 3]
Oh, but I don't wanna know
Where you go
And I don't want to see
That you're coming along with me

And I don't wanna go
Wherever you go
I want the two of us to be
Just where we know

And I don't want to know
Everything you know
And I don't wanna see
Everything you see

And I don't wanna go
Oh, wherever you go
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no
