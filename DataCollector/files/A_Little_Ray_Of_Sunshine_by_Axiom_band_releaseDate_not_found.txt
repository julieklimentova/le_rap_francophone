          
            
            Her father says:
"She has to have a name
Not the same as her mum's
But a name just the same"

A little ray of sunshine
Has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine
In the shape of a girl

We'll show her the dress
That she'll wear with
The gold flowing hair
That nature provided

A little ray of sunshine
Has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine
In the shape of a girl
A little ray of sunshine

I want to know
If you think she looks good in the pink
Her grandma has bought her
Our own little daughter

She can make you feel good
She can make you feel that it's all worthwhile
Only by her smile
Only by her smile

Have you noticed
She's just like her father
I think that i'd rather
Her hair was much darker

A little ray of sunshine
Has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine
In the shape of a girl

She can make you feel good
She can make you feel that it's all worthwhile
Only by her smile
Only by her smile
Only by her smile

Talkin' 'bout my little ray of sunshine
My little ray of sunshine
Little ray of sunshine
