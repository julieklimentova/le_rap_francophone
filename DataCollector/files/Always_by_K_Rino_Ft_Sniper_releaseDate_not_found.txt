Yeah, something we can all relate to
The pain we all share
Think about your momma
Think about your daddy
Think about your homeboy
Think about your cousin
Think about your brother
Think about your sister

[K-Rino]
Even though you rest in peacefully, grieving's never easy
While living life freely I'd never thought you'd leave me
Life lessons you would teach me and constantly receive me
Even times when you didn't agree with me completely
I can't believe this happening, I miss hearing you laughing
The gladness that we had turns to sadness when that path ends
Reality, truth hurts, the suffering grew worse
Wondering what God was telling me by taking you first
Maybe I'll just call this lost part of this harvest
And no you wasn't flawless but I loved you regardless
So even though it pains me and things are not the same we
Have to accept the change and let the will of God reign free
Paid all your dues right, now you on a new flight
Released from the painful imprisonment of this cruel life
And though your gone physically, mentally you visit me
Infinitely in my memory for all you did for me

[Hook:]
You'll always remain (where?) in my heart
(Never gon forget about ya, we ain't never gon forget about ya)
You'll always remain (remain where?) in my heart
(We ain't Never gon forget about ya)
(We ain't never gon forget)

[K-Rino]
God's glorification is women and man's mission
From the minute of your birth, your beginning, your transition
The spirit and flesh are separate, severance is definite
Whenever it ends, we're thankful for what you left us with
Not material or money, all that festers fast
And to have you back I'd trade it all no questions asked
If I had one hour with you, that might ease the circumstance
I could speak the words I should of said but never got the chance
But as I think about it I focused and saw the light
The chance for me to show you what you meant was right there all my life
Concentrating on the flesh is never wise to do
The legacy you leave is what immortalizes you
All the wisdom you was dropping then, I clearly see
Was making it that when you pass away you'll live in me
Now everyday I see just like you I pray to be
And maybe even give someone the happiness you gave to me

[Hook]

[K-Rino]
They say that pictures can't talk but yet they find the means
Cause when you look at 'em, they place you in a time machine
Next thing you know your laughing, mind state in a better place
Remembering a past moment like it was yesterday
Keep their memory alive and never let it fade
Tell your children 'bout the impact that their presence made
And even though the tears flow you gotta still rejoice
At least two or three times a day I can hear your voice
When they said that all ends with time they wasn't lying
My grandparents, Jerry, A.C. and my cousin Bryan
God is in control, know he got our best in mind
If only life was like a movie, you could press rewind
The loss of a loved one can totally engross ya
It can split a family up or it can bring them closer
Just keep in mind, the Sun shines once the night is gone
I won't pour no liquor out but I can write a song
