You know I love you, boy
In every single way
Though I love you, boy
I'll miss you every day
Oh, I love you, boy
I wish that I could stay with you
And keep the life I made with you
And even though this feels so right
I'm holding back the tears tonight

It's true, I'll never be over you
'Cause I have built a future in my mind with you
And now the hope is gone, there's nothing left for me to do
You know it isn't true
But I must say to you
That I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
It'll never be better than it was, no, no
But I don't need your love, no, no

I've got no choice
With the King, I stay alive
Never had a choice
Been a wife twice before just to survive
I don't have a choice
If Henry says it's you, then it's you
No matter how I feel, it's what I have to do
But if, somehow, I had that choice
No holding back, I'd raise my voice

I'd say, "Henry, yeah, it's true, I'll never belong to you
'Cause I am not your toy to enjoy till there's something new
As if I'm gonna give up my boy, my work, my dreams to care for you, ha!
Darling, get a clue
There's nothing you can do
I don't need your love, no, no
No, I don't need your love, no, no
There's nothing left to discuss, no, no
But I don't need your love, no, no"

(spoken)
But I can't say that
Not to the king
So this is goodbye
All my love, Catherine

(sung)
So I sent that letter to my love, got married to the king
Became the one who survived
I've told you about my life, the final wife
But why should that story
Be the one I have to sing about
Just to win? I'm out
That's not my story
There's so much more
Remember that I was a writer
I wrote books and psalms and meditations
Fought for female education
So all my women can independently study scripture
I even got a woman to paint my picture
Why can't I tell that story?
'Cause in history
I'm fixed as one of six
And without him
I disappear
We all disappear

[CATHERINE OF ARAGON]
So we had no choice

[ANNE BOLEYN]
But now it's us alone

[JANE SEYMOUR]
So we've got no choice

[ANNA OF CLEVES]
No, we've got no choice

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
We're taking back the microphone

[CATHERINE PARR]
I'm gonna raise my voice

[ALL]
They always said we need your love
But it's time for us to rise above
It's not what went down in history
But tonight, I'm singing this for me

[ALL, CATHERINE PARR]
Henry, yeah, I'm through, too many times it's been told
And I have had enough (I've had enough) love stories to get old
And you might think it's tough, but I've got to let your love run cold
We're taking back control (We're taking back control)
You need to know
I don't need your love (Hey), no, no (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
No, I don't need your love, no, no
Can't let it get the better of us, no, no (Woo)
I don't need your love, no, no

I don't (Hey) need your love, no, no (I don't need your love)
(I don't need your love)
No, I don't need your love, no, no (I don't need your love)
I don't need your love, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
I don't need your love

[CATHERINE PARR]
We don't need your love
