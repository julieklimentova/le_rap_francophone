          
            
            [Verse 1]

I wear my clothes across the room
Cause I'm passionate, just not enough
Could do it now, but I got all day
I'm not the same as I was yesterday

[Chorus]

Sweet tea where'd you go, I miss you
You know I'm nothing without you
Sweet tea where'd you go, I miss you
You know I'm nothing without you

[Verse 2]

I dream of days, when days fall through
Yeah I'm passionate, just not enough
Could stick around, but that's okay
I'm tired of these clouds now, anyway

[Chorus]
Sweet tea where'd you go, I miss you
You know I'm nothing without you
Sweet tea where'd you go, I miss you
You know I'm nothing without you

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
Sweet tea where'd you go, I miss you
You know I'm nothing without you
Sweet tea where'd you go, I miss you
You know I'm nothing without you
