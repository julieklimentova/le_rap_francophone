          
            
            [Verse 1: Pierce Brosnan]
Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

[Chorus: Pierce Brosnan]
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

[Verse 2: Meryl Streep]
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love?
It used to be so good

[Chorus: Pierce Brosnan, Meryl Streep]
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

[Chorus: Pierce Brosnan, Meryl Streep, Both]
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone (When you're gone)
Though I try how can I carry on?
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone (When you're gone)
Though I try how can I carry on?
