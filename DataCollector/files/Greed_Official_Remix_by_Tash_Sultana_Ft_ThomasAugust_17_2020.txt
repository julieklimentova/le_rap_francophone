          
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
They only give—

[Chorus]
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down

[Post-Chorus]
You gotta hold it—

[Pre-Chorus]
They only give a shit

[Chorus]
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back whеn you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down
Thеy only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down

[Post-Chorus]
You gotta hold it—

[Outro]
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down
You gotta hold it down
