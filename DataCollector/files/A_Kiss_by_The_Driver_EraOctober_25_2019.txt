Apparently I've lost control
To all my friends that told me so
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 1]
Look out, I'm on a wave
Don't give a fuck of what you say
Apparently I've lost control
To all my friends that told me so
Well, just get out the way
Because we don't want to behave
Apparently you lost control
You never really had before

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, ooh, you changed, you're not the same
You're different than the way that I loved you
Oh, the way that I loved you
But honestly, it won't matter in day or so
So why are you so precious about it?
So precious about it

[Chorus]
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
Ha, it's just a little kiss
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ha, it's just a little—

[Verse 2]
I was bent a couple days
Still kept the feeling in my face (Well, sorta)
Well, why is it that you're so scared?
Or is it that you're unaware?
Just let me have my phase
I didn't grab her by mistake (No)
We're dancing like we lost control
Irrelevant are times before, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, ooh, you changed, you're not the same
You're different than the way that I loved you
Oh, the way that I loved you
But honestly, it won't matter in day or so
So why are you so precious about it?
So precious about it

[Chorus]
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
Ha, it's just a little kiss

[Bridge]
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ha, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little kiss
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
It's just a little—

[Chorus]
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss, ah
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little

[Chorus]
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss, ah
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
Ha, it's just a little kiss
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ha, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little kiss

[Outro]
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ha, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little—
