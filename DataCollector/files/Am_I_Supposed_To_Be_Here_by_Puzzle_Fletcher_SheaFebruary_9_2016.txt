          
            
            Sometimes i know
I'm living with another
But when time passes
I'm just a simple brother
Guilt builds
In my heart
Who does this belong to
Why did this all start
I don't fucking know
And I don't want to care
But this is my soul, man
And it's too much to bare
Guilt builds
In my heart
Who does this belong to
Why did this all start

I, Am I supposed to be here?
And how in the fuck did I get here?
How, did I fall?
Was I looking good?
Or not at all?
