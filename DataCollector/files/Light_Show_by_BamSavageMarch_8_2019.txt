          
            
            [Chorus]
Every time I smile, it's a light show (It's a light show)
You say that you get money but you lied though (But you lied, ho)
If you fuckin' with me, you alright though (Yeah)
I can't trust that bitch 'cause she a night ho (Yeah)
If a nigga want the smoke, I want all the smoke
If a bitch gonna love me, fuck, I want all her throat
I be wonderin' how she found out all them songs I wrote
If a nigga gon' try me, you know it is a joke

[Verse 1]
I pop a Percocet, molly, and then I hydro
I fucked that bitch one time, I had my eyes closed
All these niggas be screamin' fuck 12 and five-oh
Brand new, 2018, got a Bentley coupe
I'm gon' fuck that bitch over somethin' new
I only fuck that ho when I'm in the mood
Yeah, I keep them drugs tucked up in my room
And every time I smile, bitch, I bust a move

[Chorus]
Every time I smile, it's a light show (It's a light show)
You say that you get money but you lied though (But you lied, ho)
If you fuckin' with me, you alright though (Yeah)
I can't trust that bitch 'cause she a night ho (Yeah)
If a nigga want the smoke, I want all the smoke
If a bitch gonna love me, fuck, I want all her throat
I be wonderin' how she found out all them songs I wrote
If a nigga gon' try me, you know it is a joke

[Verse 2]
Twenty-five hundred for like every tooth
Ten more bust down, nigga, what it do?
45K when I'm in the booth
Rob a fuck nigga for his fuckin' food
Snooze you lose, yeah, you know it's BamSavage
I might fuck the bitch, make it happen
Keep it real solid, but my guns, they clappin'
Uh, yeah, you know I started trappin'

[Chorus]
Every time I smile, it's a light show (It's a light show)
You say that you get money but you lied though (But you lied, ho)
If you fuckin' with me, you alright though (Yeah)
I can't trust that bitch 'cause she a night ho (Yeah)
If a nigga want the smoke, I want all the smoke
If a bitch gonna love me, fuck, I want all her throat
I be wonderin' how she found out all them songs I wrote
If a nigga gon' try me, you know it is a joke
