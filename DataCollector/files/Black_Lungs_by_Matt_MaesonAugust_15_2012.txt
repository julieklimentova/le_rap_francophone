          
            
            [Verse 1]
While there's a darkness in my head
Growing stronger and it sways my weary self
And there's an evil creeping in
It eats my skin and takes my form, it's very wrong

[Chorus]
Please just let me breathe like I used to do
Please just let me see like I did
Please just let me breathe like when my lungs weren't black
Please just let me see like before I saw death

[Verse 2]
I can't pretend to see you're the same
When I was ten and they would preach your holy name
'Cause you were oh so magical
But I've grown old and my mind's so practical

[Chorus]
Please just let me breathe like I used to do
Please just let me see like I did
Please just let me breathe like when my lungs weren't black
Please just let me see like before I saw death

[Bridge]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

'Cause I've done so many things that should
Make you hate me and forget my name, oh god
I've done so many things that should
Make you hate me and forget my name

[Outro]
So, why don't you just turn your back?
Why don't you just turn your back?
Why don't you just turn your back?
'Cause you know that I already have
Why don't you just turn your back?
Why don't you just turn your back?
Why don't you just turn your back?
'Cause you know that I already have
