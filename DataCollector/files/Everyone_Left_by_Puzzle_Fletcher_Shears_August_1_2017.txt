          
            
            [Chorus]
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?

[Verse 1]
Careful getting close
Keep a loving heart on its toes
Was this all for nothing?
What do I have to show
Spent a lot of time
Not an hour I regret though
The only thing I question
Is how easy it was for her
To let go

[Chorus]
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?
It's like riding a mother fucking bike they say
Just hit the ground running real fast, okay?

[Verse 2]
Night after night
I let emotions go
The kind you hold on to
No matter where you go
Would've kept them forever
Stuck like cement
If I would've heard back
Wondering where they went

[Bridge]
Guess when you turn out the lights
You can't really see much anymore
Guess when you're left in the dark
Nobody's there to show you the door
Yeah

[Outro]
Guess when you turn out the lights
You can't really see much anymore
Guess when you're left in the dark
Nobody's there to show you the door
Yeah, I said nobody's there
To show you the door
Yeah
