Ayo Diesel
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there homie
Hahahahaha
Flame no bitches
No anyone of you will stop me
Even if you need it I'm so crazy
You won't believe how it gets juicy (Eklips is crazy, definitly)
I'll make you happy
I'll make you happy
No anyone of you will stop me
Beat-boxin'
With his fuckin' mouth
- Hey yo, Slim
- Waddup Bus' ?
- Are you ready to kill this shit right now ?
- Yeah

[Couplet 1 : Imitation Eminem]
Winning and whining as I enter the building like I'm a swing
Lying and flying over 'em as I'm dissing
Slim Shady and the rest of them
Singing and the bitches over them
Motherfuck you, I'm too [wet?] for them
Singing, "XXX buried them"
Crews, I choose to lose
Picking on them fools and Jews
[Make an omen?] [choose?] excuse
Breaking all them rules
Fuck France, fuck America
You and your camera
Eklips I'm a suicidal, I'm a motherfucking murderer

[Couplet 2 : Imitation Drake]
I hold a lot of Drakes around
But only one Drake's gonna break it down
I hear a lot of fakes wanna snatch the ground
XXX lotta snakes they shoot me a crown
A bitch spinning around and XXX in the crowd
Straight bullet in the world around and around
I can't even be singing (???)
I swear it will be the last time I'm singing

[Couplet 3 : Imitation Jay Z]
H-O-V, Jigga man
All I have to boil, be the ex of a bigger man
You will not *** [felony?] me your request to the nation
Bla** is not gonna be a rock celebration
I wanna rock right now
*** to see and get hoes think about
Now I'm 22 in my shoes like I'm bigger
Take a look around no one laughing in the house but Jigger

[Refrain]
Shady, Drizzy, Jay Z and Fifty
Busta, welcome to Paris
Now, put your hands up in the air
Je veux voir toutes les mains en l'air
No anyone of you will stop me
Even if you think I'm so crazy
You won't believe how it gets juicy
I make you happy
I make you happy

[Couplet 4 : Imitation 50 Cent]
Haha, haha, yeah
Every shorty wanna call me a pimp millionaire
Always been where I go before I get there
I'ma take it to the club XXX
Make it back home and finally camp on the bed
[Hump?] to the to the moon
Move to the bedroom
Chicks wanna get on, on, on it
And I get it, I pursue
Anywhere XXX do
Everybody get on, on, on it

[Couplet 5 : Imitation Busta Rhymes]
Stealing the ladies from motherfuckers who think I'm a XXX
So much XXX wanna step on my [cheddars?]
You in the zone in the hour of power
Get heated up in the club when bitches show me the [dollar?]
Homie take it to the next
I'm reviewing the checks
And make you itch in your ex
When I am done having sex
Sling more bitches with the opposites
Bus-a-Bus, we're driving shit
Into sandwiches come on

[Couplet 6 : Eklips]
La crème de la crème, en un track c'est la dream team
De le East Coast trime, rime sur de la grosse caisse, grosse prose
(Vroom vroom, start it up !) No stress quand j'pose
Eklips te fait un G.X, j't'explose
Paris - New York, flow Outre Atlantique
Toujours authentique de gimmicks toujours authentiques
Quand le beat box retentit, "T'entends ?" j't'ai dit
Que j'allais m'attaquer aux cains-ri', aux MCs des Etats-Unis

[Refrain]
Shady, Drizzy, Jay Z and Fifty
Busta, welcome to Paris
Now, put your hands up in the air
Je veux voir toutes les mains en l'air
American psycho, E-K-L-I-P-S
American psycho, E-K-L-I-P-S
Shady, Drizzy, Jay Z, Fifty
Bus-a-Bus now, all I need is one mouth
Come on
No anyone of you will stop me
Even if you think it I'm so crazy
You won't beleive how it gets juicy
I make you happy
I make you happy
All I need is one mouth
E-K-L-I-P-S man
Haha
