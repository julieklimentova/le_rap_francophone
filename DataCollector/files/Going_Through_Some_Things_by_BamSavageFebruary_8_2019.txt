Honorable C.N.O.T.E

[Chorus]
I'm going through some things, got some demons in my head
Geeked up in the crib with a white bitch in my bed
I been going through some things, got them demons in my head
Geeked up in the crib with a white bitch in my bed
I might have anxiety if I don't take my meds
And if I kill myself, don't you ever call the feds
If you ever find me dead, leave me geeked up in my bed
I been running twelve deep with this bitch up and her friends

[Verse 1]
All these niggas rapping but I think it is a trend
All these bitches trying to fuck me on they camera lens
If you hear me now, baby girl, this is the end
If you hear me now, baby girl, this is the end
She gon' fuck me on demand
Baby girl, I am the man
Yeah you know I got blue faces
I be thumbing through these bands
She gon' fuck me on demand
She gon' fuck me on command
Uh, she gon' fuck me on command

[Chorus]
I'm going through some things, got some demons in my head
Geeked up in the crib with a white bitch in my bed
I been going through some things, got them demons in my head
Geeked up in the crib with a white bitch in my bed
I might have anxiety if I don't take my meds
And if I kill myself, don't you ever call the feds
If you ever find me dead, leave me geeked up in my bed
I been running twelve deep with this bitch up and her friends

[Verse 2]
It's okay I live forever
Fuck her once and forget her
You and me gon' be together
Yeah, you know I'm here forever
Uh, I'll be here forever now
I might just go smoke a pound
I'll be here forever now
I might just go burn a pound

[Chorus]
I'm going through some things, got some demons in my head
Geeked up in the crib with a white bitch in my bed
I been going through some things, got them demons in my head
Geeked up in the crib with a white bitch in my bed
I might have anxiety if I don't take my meds
And if I kill myself, don't you ever call the feds
If you ever find me dead, leave me geeked up in my bed
I been running twelve deep with this bitch up and her friends

[Outro]
Ayy, whoa
Uh, ayy, ayy
Uh, ayy, ayy, whoa
