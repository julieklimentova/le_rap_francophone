          
            
            If you cherish her
Don't watch her walk
You think you'll marry her?
Don't let it slip away
You're never told a thing
But you learn real real fast
You try to make it work
Well you've gotta try harder than that

If you're falling hard
Tell her how you really feel
You think it's in between?
Don't make her wait
If love isn't something you're feeling
Continue on your path
But don't make her wait
