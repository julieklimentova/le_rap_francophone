          
            
            [Verse 1]
Oh, my baby
You look so sweet
Won't you sit next to me?
It's all I need
Oh so tempting
Cold like the breeze
But you're warm like the beach
It's what I need (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bare skin, so bright, sun kissed, those eyes
Telling me something
Telling me something

[Chorus]
You keep it natural, natural
Turn it up, strip it down
Clothes on the ground
Don't you make me wait too long
Keep it natural, natural
Turn it up, strip it down
Clothes on the ground
Don't you make me wait too long

[Verse 2]
Oh, sometimes I
Get caught in between
You're salty and sweet
I'll drink your need

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Fresh squeezed, so clean, all day, you keep
Telling me something
Telling me something

[Chorus]
You keep it natural, natural
Turn it up, strip it down
Clothes on the ground
Don't you make me wait too long
Keep it natural, natural
Turn it up, strip it down
Clothes on the ground
Don't you make me wait too long

[Bridge]
Girl, you keep it real
I keep it raw
Girl, you keep it real
I keep it raw
Girl, you keep it real
I keep it raw
Girl, you keep it real
I keep it raw

[Chorus]
You keep it natural, natural
Turn it up, strip it down
Clothes on the ground
Don't you make me wait too long
Keep it natural, natural
Turn it up, strip it down
Clothes on the ground
Don't you make me wait too long

[Outro]
Girl. you keep it real
I keep it raw
Girl, you keep it real
I keep it raw
Girl, you keep it real
I keep it raw
Girl, you keep it real
I keep it raw
Natural, natural
