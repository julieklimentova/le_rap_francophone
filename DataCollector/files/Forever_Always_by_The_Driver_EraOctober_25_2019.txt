          
            
            [Verse 1]
('Til forever always)
Take me from my ocean view
Now what do I become to you? Oh
Strip you from the numbers, your hot girl summer
Fades to the cold, does it ever get warmer?
Maybe you're a cover, complacent to the stubborn
But you keep it so clean and it's just for the others
Yeah, it’s all for the others now

[Chorus]
You're doing bad things
I'm doing the same (Oh)
And you want me to stay (Stay, stay, stay)
Before it's too late (Late, late, late)
'Til forever always
'Til forever always
'Til forever always
'Til forever always (Forever, just you and me)
'Til forever always
'Til forever always (Til forever always)
(Forever, just you and me)
(Forever)

[Verse 2]
Take my BMW
You can empty out my pockets too
And now you're wearing nothing, there's no point bluffing
Thinking too many times, sure to find something
I have you all uncovered and still I wonder
How one can be as certain, less it's all for the others now, oh
Oh, yeah, it's all for the others now

[Chorus]
You're doing bad things
I'm doing the same (Oh)
And you want me to stay (Stay, stay, stay)
Before it's too late (Late, late, late)
'Til forever always ('Til forever always)
'Til forever always ('Til forever always)
'Til forever always ('Til forever always)
'Til forever always ('Til forever always)
(Forever, just you and me)
'Til forever always
'Til forever always
(Forever, just you and me)

[Outro]
('Til forever always)
('Til forever always)
('Til forever always)
('Til forever always)
'Til forever always
'Til forever always
'Til forever always
'Til forever always (Just you and me)
'Til forever always
(Just you and me)
