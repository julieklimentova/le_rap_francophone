          
            
            [Chorus]
You sat on my mind
For a great amount of time
You ran on my soul
For the longest I didn't know

[Verse 1]
I've been planting seeds in my head
Before the shine and all
Though I really tried to forget
I can't escape the call

[Chorus]
You sat on my mind
For a great amount of time
You ran on my soul
For the longest I didn't know

[Verse 2]
It's my fate
It's my chance
It's my paint
I cannot backpedal
It was written
Not up there
But by my hands

[Outro]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the love
Now I gotta go
I love you so
Sorry, I'm so sorry
Sorry, I'm so sorry
