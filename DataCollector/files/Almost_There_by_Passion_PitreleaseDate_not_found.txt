          
            
            There are things you’ll never learn
Like there’s nothing to hide from
House of people at your door
Give it away they’ll just take more
But I don’t know what you want
But I can’t get it out of my brain
Yeah you’re almost there

There are things you’ll never do
Like even try to hurt me too
God knows something more than ruin
Put your down and cleans my moods
All this talk of swear and can’t get it out of my brain
Yeah you’re almost there
Yeah you’re almost there
