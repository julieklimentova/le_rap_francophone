          
            
            [Verse 1]
Clear your schedule 'cause, baby, I'm
Comin' through for the night
You say you don't got time, yeah
We both know that's a lie
I'll pretend to love you, pretend to love me
While we just waste time, this shit gets ugly
We're fadin' (We're fadin')
We're fadin' (We're fadin')
You ruin my day, we argue all night
And then we make up, pretend it's alright
I hate it (Hate it)
I hate it (Hate it)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all you wanna do is play with my heart
Even when I know I'm right, I'm still wrong
I don't even wanna stay for that long
Always passin' out blame like my fault

[Chorus]
I think I'ma be better off (Better off)
'Cause you and me just can't get along (Get along)
I guess I wasn't what you want (What you want)
Baby, I don't know what you want (What you want)
I guess I'ma be better off (Better off)
'Cause you and me just can't get along (Get along)
I guess I wasn't what you want (What you want)
Baby, I don't know what you want (What you want)

[Verse 2]
Too scared to go
I don't wanna leave 'cause you're all I know
I know I'ma bleed, but I need to grow
Gotta find it out now or I'll never know
You took a part of me (Part of me)
But you can't take all of me (All of me)
'Cause if I never fall in love (Fall in love)
I know inside I got enough (Got enough)
So please don't try stopping me (Stopping me)
Don't make this hard for me (Hard for me)
You treat me like I'm not enough (I'm not enough)
I just realized I'm not in love (I'm not in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all you wanna do is play with my heart
Even when I know I'm right, I'm still wrong
I don't even wanna stay for that long
Always passin' out blame like my fault

[Chorus]
I think I'ma be better off (Better off)
'Cause you and me just can't get along (Get along)
I guess I wasn't what you want (What you want)
Baby, I don't know what you want (What you want)
I guess I'ma be better off (Better off)
'Cause you and me just can't get along (Get along)
I guess I wasn't what you want (What you want)
Baby, I don't know what you want (What you want)
