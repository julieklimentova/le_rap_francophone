          
            
            [Verse 1]
Well I was going down on my lines
And I heard that the waiting feel was fine
But I was reading in between the lies
Like I had my hands right over my eyes
See, this is what I despise
Of you and I

[Verse 2]
I took a trip to the dark side
I placed it on my tongue
Re-wired my whole brain
Started hell it begun
The world drained from colour
Black and white was the sun
I forgot my own name
I forgot who I was

[Chorus]
But when the big smoke comes
I know the way
'Cause I wanna
Guide your love
Guide your love back home
'Cause when the big smoke comes
I know the way
'Cause I wanna guide your love
Back home
