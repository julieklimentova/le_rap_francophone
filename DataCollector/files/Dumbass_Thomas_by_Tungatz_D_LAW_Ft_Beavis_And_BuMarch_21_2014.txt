[Beavis]
Dumbass

[Butt-Head]
Im afraid Im gonna have to kick your ass

[Beavis]
Yeah,c'mon Butt-Head,we can annihilate them
Kick 'em in the nads!

[Verse 1: Tungatz D'Law]
Fuck all the people that ever had doubts of me
Letting the non-believers know that they are just gasoline
For the fire I'm spitting and statistics for my Rap-soleum
The same that laugh at me when I started
Will be the same that will be crowning me
Suckin' my dick and asking for counseling
Never needed your books or academy,I'm so proud of me
'bout to pee on all these mothafuckas that wanna battle me
You know I ain't goin' to lose so betta jump off a balcony
'cause every minute is critical when you fighting with me
And your lyrics are pitiful when you target at me
Imma lyrical miracle,bet you didn't know this biblical
Oh shit,I'm the Jesus of the rap game
Every mixtape it's a die and resurrect shit
And everytime I give these suckas a migrane
'cause everytime I'm way more harder,a nightmare
For all you lame ass rappers,ballet dancers on tight pants
My verses are like bullets and I shoot 'em at ya chest
(Are you treathning me?)
(Absolutely!)
You gotta be the foolest 'cause your bulletproof vest
Can't stop this heavy caliber,just proofs that I'm the best

[Hook]
Dumbass Thomas (You,you,you,you,you dumbass)
Uh,yeah,Dumbass Thomas (You,you,you,you,you dumbass)

[Butt-Head]
That was cool!

[Beavis]
Heh,that dude is pretty cool!

[Butt-Head]
This dude is definetely cool

[Tungatz D'LAW]
Thanks bruh but I guess that's it

[Beavis & Butt-Head]
No,no,no,don't stop!!
Don't stop! don't stop!
Heh-heh,Damn it...
Quitters never win!

[Tungatz D'LAW]
Hmm,aight bruh just one more verse

[Beavis and Butt-Head]
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yea,go for it! yeah,go for it!
Ok dude,you ready? (Hell yeah y'all!!)
Dropping plates on yo' ass biyatch!!!

[Verse 2]
Fuck it,I'm gon' to say it,I want the money and the fame
But mixed with art from the heart,this ain't just for entertain
If I were on that shit,I'll be making meaningless Reggaeton
But this shit got a meaning and of course it weight a Ton
I be the champion of the world like Floyd Mayweather
Joinin' forces with Predator and Thor,vendetta
Coming at you mothafuckas like a storm,umbrellas
Won't help you at all 'cause in this rap shit,I go extra violent
Got your atention,now you remaining silent
I'm Tungatz a.k.a Felino cause at this shit I'm wildin'!!
Shit! you got a problem with me?
This is for all the suckas that need to see to believe!
Yeah I was low-key like Milwaukee
Now I'm Obi-Wan Kenoby,got the force of the most holy
And I'm ballin' just like Kobe,kill the track until it's totally amazing,you know me
Yeah that's the fuckin' reason why I do everything slowly!
If you don't like it how I do it,you can always blow me
For the only person I work for,yep it's for me
Real O.G but many gangsters against us,Oh Jesus!!
Got a demon in me,man you better call now the priest

[Beavis & Butt-Head]
Boy you're pretty good at this game
This dude just keeps gettin' better
Don't screw with him
