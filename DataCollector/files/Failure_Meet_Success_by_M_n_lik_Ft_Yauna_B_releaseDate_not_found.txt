I gotta get it
I gotta get it
I gotta get it
And if it's out of my reach then
I'm gonna stretch in the morning
Get up out the bed and grind
Cause my family has got to eat
See all the haters want me dead cause I stay up on my grind
They putting prices on my head I got money on my mind
I think I finally made it, failure meet success

[Verse 1: Menelik]
See I'm rising from the bottom this as hard it gets
I found my passion in this rap now I'm delivering this
Friends switching up when you rising to the fame
They ain't getting what it takes to be establishing a name
Any trip u take want a plane ticket too
And any broad u get in they trying to get in them too
Second that you signed they asking where they cut at
Hittin u wit bs lines like where the love at
They thinkin simple if u got u can spend it
But I'm trying to eat for life so what I earn I ain't gone lend it
Taking this here serious got the whole world curious
Lounging on grind that's got the women all delirious
Day by day I'm engraving my name deeper
Never waisting time as an insomniac sleeper
No fear in my step cause I know just where I'm going
Even without a beat these words gone keep on flowing

[Hook: Yauna B]
I gotta get it

[Verse 2: Menelik]
These diggers out here schemin when they see my ears gleamin
And they everywhere I turn you would think I was dreamin (man)
Hates brewin in my enemies eyes
It comes wit the success that's along wit the lies (yup)
Seems no matter what I do it'll never be good enough
But its not up to they standards for my life that I'm livin up (nah)
I'm goin in so my family can eat
Big plates plenty to go 'round we all have a feast
Large house on the hill so I can shelter 'em all
Snag a deal and not I, but we all gone ball
Most anticipated moment for a artist on the mission
While my face on ya tv what ya life been missin (haaa)
Fullfillin the prophecy we posed to be on top
They can weigh a couple tons still gettin knocked out the spot
I ain't cocky I'm determined to make this actuality
Not to mention I'd love the boost in my overall salary

[Hook: Yauna B]
