Bring me up down
Bring me up down

Bring me up down, want you bring me up
Bring them all around so they see me work
Bring me up down, want you bring me up

[Interlude]
Let me tell you my story

[Part 1]
Bring me up down, want you bring me up
Bring'em all around so they see me work
Leaving good sounds
Yeah have good sounds
Making someone bright
Never leave the ground
I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way
Come my hero and try to save the day
Living for the king, living for the king
Hope they see the day that the kingdom rings

[Bridge]
I know you can see the light that shines
Trough these waves
I'm spreading my peace
I hope you take this from me

[Hook]
Won't you come alive, then hear the wonders all
Music all around you feel it in your heart
Know that no one dies or leave it like you know
Where the heaven's bright is where I want to go

[Part 2]
Looking at the sky, looking to the top
Praying he will take all my people up
I am what he made, I am what I am
Knowing that the wise that will understand
We can go a long, go a long way
Everybody hoping, come along say:
We are what we are, we are what we made
Moving so we get to a better day

[Bridge]
I know you can see the light that shines
Through these waves
I'm spreading my peace
I hope you take this from me

[Hook]
Won't you come alive, then hear the wonders all
Music all around you feel it in your heart
Know that no one dies or leave it like you know
Where the heaven's bright is where I want to go


[Outro]
Where I want to go
Where I want to go
Where I want to go
Where I want to go

Bring me up down, bring'em all around
Bring me up down, bring'em all around
Bring me up down, bring'em all around
Bring me up down, bring'em all around
