          
            
            [Verse 1]
I wish you well
I wish y'all niggas well
Even if you don't like me
Even if you hope I fell
I wish you gon' be better
Stronger than what you hate
Put in work what you're thinking of
Living with no regrets
I wish you gonna wake the fuck up
Move your lazy ass up
'fore you be waiting another year
They wanna do it like me
Yet they don't understand
That I really forgot where's my bed
And I wish they'll finally pay me
80$ for a show, nigga what you think?
Thinking I'm a fool cuz I'm underrated
2K17 I'm ready no one's foolin Ril√®s
Can I do it?
Of course I can
I wish y'all ready for all my crazy-ass plans
You see me growing
I know you like it
2k17 I swear you gonna feel it baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I remain insane
And won't listen what they say
I wish I remain insane
Nigga we ain't the same
Cuz I fuck with myself
So I'm ready
Cuz this year's about to get down
I hope you're ready
Imma show them, still on my own

[Chorus]
Baby don't care what they say
I can easily fuck 'em all
Happy new year hatin' ass niggas
Y'all have a lot on your plate now
Baby don't care what they say
I will easily fuck 'em all
Happy new year hatin' ass niggas
Y'all have a lot on your plate now

[Verse 2]
I wish you'll stop listening with your eyes
Again turning your greatest resolutions into lies
I wish that all these radios will finally realize
That the internet gon' take over if they keep playing trash
I know you want that money but, just, please make up your mind
The  culture is way more bigger than all these industry clows
Major part of your audience is 6th graders
The rest moved on to Spotify
Talking to French radios
Wake the fuck up it's my time, heyy
It's all about the gravity
All about the gravity
Yem I say, heyy
Cuz I know the secret
Yes I know the secret

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I remain insane
And won't listen what they say
I wish I remain insane
Nigga we ain't the same
Cuz I fuck with myself
So I'm ready
Cuz this year's about to get down
I hope you're ready
Imma show them, still on my own

[Chorus]
Baby don't care what they say
I can easily fuck 'em all
Happy new year hatin' ass niggas
Y'all have a lot on your plate now
Baby don't care what they say
I will easily fuck 'em all
Happy new year hatin' ass niggas
Y'all have a lot on your plate now
