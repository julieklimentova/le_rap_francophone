Bitch I'm back on the H-Block
Same vest but a new Glock
Who's these new opps?
Fuck 12
I hate cops
Big Opps got my face hot
Free the guys
They got state time
Free Rasha, free A-Rod
Lil bitch I'm Get Straight
Gets money
I need mine
So all calls get declined
Got no time to hear she whine
I Can't lack
I keep mine
So keep my name out them weak lines
Tired of these goofys talking about Hot-Rod
And they did not do that
You got shot already
Who did you shoot back?
Pussy boy gotta prove that
Fuck a blicky
We got choppas
Don't come through here tryna shoot that
What's the make it back to your boo facts?
Last nigga pistol got removed
Along with his shoes facts
Too hot to talk New facts
They like, "Jezz, why you do that?"
Lil Mister
How your ass gonna last on the strip
When your ass getting stripped?
Pop Out when it's fog
No analog
But I Move with the sticks
60z, fuck a 30
When this milky rock
You better be sturdy
Albion Court
I call Rah Swish
Now we doing drills in a jersey
You Not a big opps
You don't spin no blocks
Why you think nobody's worried?
Most of my niggas got in they bag
Most of they niggas got buried
They like, "Jezz Hot like fever"
I'm on that young pop
When he did Ether
The last nigga was just tryna get pizza
Instead of Dominos
Should've got Little Caesars
Now his ass is deceased
No bikes
Just SRTs And CLS
No BMX
When I say gun beating like Blaze
Cause we beat him to death
I Know some Apes
But I'm not talking Ape when these shells beat on your chest
So much opps
Don't know who to shoot
But they know what to expect
Close-range face shots
Bullets When through his specs
Got the opps all upset
But they ain't do nothing yet
Yellow tape and choppers
Somebody got hit
Hit the rock
I was jacking my shit
Shoot a nigga
Then go bump my whip
[?] tryna flip niggas shit
This real life shit
Free Stu
They tryna give bro some shit
Flo dope
This shit is like a brick
And you softer than the lines that you sniff
Gotta be high off that shit
Don't care if you got it
Beam on the glizzy
You could die with that shit
Yeah, I'm with the shits
Shoot a nigga while he with his bitch
Yeah shawty it's Litt
730 Locos, just talking shit

[Verse 2: Paparattzi Pop]
1 thing's for sure
2 things for certain
They ain't making it back to they bed if we see niggas tryna ride to Wortman
All black suits and hearses
227 Sullivan
Knock knock
Hello come again
Make them think we UPS
Once they open up
We coming in
Yeah I'm on that type of time
Get your gun and get your gang
Slipping it's gonna be some wicks
Whole lot of picture frames
Ain't no competitors
I'm here to let niggas know
This is Big Opps America
Pillow talking to these bitches
My drop is the thottie that's laying in bed with ya
Niggas be talking about spinning through Linden
But niggas ain't slide through yet
Blaze died
Who's next?
Say my name and you next

Keep that energy when I run into you
I ain't tryna be friends, homies, or none of that
Nigga I'm tryna he rid of you
GANG

[Verse 3: Kj Balla]

They talk like they with it
They say that they 'bout it
But still ain't 'gon ride for they mans
