          
            
            [Hook: Bakar]
I feel comfy on my own
Just beware they'll take your phone
Good at walking, my ten toes
In the fields, not on the roads
I'm out here so rock and roll
Cocaine, yeah, it touch my nose (Snorts)
Pistol in hand, lock and load (Ch-ch)
All my niggas lose control (Bah!)
I feel comfy on my own (Bah!)
Just beware they'll take your phone
Good at walking, my ten toes
In the fields, not on the roads
I'm out here so rock and roll
Cocaine, yeah, it touch my nose
Pistol in hand, lock and load
Sweg, like

[Verse 1: Milkavelli]
I feel comfy on my own
I feel cozy, wavy bone
I take acid on my own
But still go home for Sunday roast (Like)
And again it's, "Blah-blah!" (Cheese)
Baggy denim Carhartt jeans
Can of Stella Artois, please
Had to tell him wagwan, greaze
I'm in the rave
Creeping, creeping, tryna find a hoe (Grr-ah)
Shades on, eyes low (Hoe)
I pick her like a game of eeny, meeny, miny, moe (La)
Beat the game (Aye), I'm in GTA mode (Sweg)
Driving on the road (Sweg)
In the CLA smoking B&H Gold
Aye

[Hook: Bakar]
I feel comfy on my own
Just beware they'll take your phone
Good at walking, my ten toes
In the fields, not on the roads
I'm out here so rock and roll
Cocaine, yeah, it touch my nose
Pistol in hand, lock and load
Sweg, aye (La)

[Verse 2: Milkavelli]
I feel comfy, on my own
Taking flights, around the globe
Houdini, cloud of smoke
I said now you see me, now you don't (Where's he gone?)
Rose gold rope chain
Pitchfork, many multicoloured stones
Laigon life, till they take my life
That's on everything I fucking own
Trailblazer, 616, I'm a Hell raiser
VVS is in the inhaler
It ain't safe on the block, they can smell danger
Eccy in me, loved up (Jeez)
Plate of [?] pub grub, please
Greatness only, one blood jeans
Paisley open untucked, steez

[Hook: Bakar]
I feel comfy on my own
Just beware they'll take your phone
Good at walking, my ten toes
In the fields, not on the roads
I'm out here so rock and roll
Cocaine, yeah, it touch my nose
Pistol in hand, lock and load
Aye (Shh)

[Hook: Milkavelli]
I feel comfy on my own
Just beware they'll take your phone
Good at walking, my ten toes
In the fields, not on the roads
I'm out here so rock and roll
Cocaine, yeah, it touch my nose
Pistol in hand, lock and load
All my crackers lose control

[Outro: Bakar]
All my niggas lose control
All my niggas lose control
