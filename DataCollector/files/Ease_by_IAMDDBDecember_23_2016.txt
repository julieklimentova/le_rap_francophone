          
            
            [Intro]
Yeah, 'cause IAMDDB, gang
With a whole new swing, yeah
A whole new swing

[Verse]
Skipping through the streets I'm calm
Surrounding what I want
Lost something from underneath
I can see my enemy, I'm free
Oh, I think I like what I see, yeah (Think I like what I see)
The best of me

[Chorus]
'Cause I might stand up, I might fall
I keep it moving, on my own
Standing really tall on my ten toes
I'm really out here, where's my gold?
Yeah, where's my gold?
Yeah (Where's my gold?)

[Bridge]
Why every time
I try I go so far away
Into a galaxy, into blue insanity? (IAMDDB)
But where I go I know I'll find
Some peace of mind (Peace of mind)
Some loving arms (Loving arms)
I realign

[Chorus]
'Cause I might stand up, I might fall
I keep it moving, on my own
Standing really tall on, my ten toes
I'm really out here, where's my gold?
'Cause I might stand up, I might fall (I might fall)
I keep it moving, on my own
Standing really tall on, my ten toes
I'm really out here, where's my gold? (Where's my gold?)
Yeah

[Outro]
'Cause it's a mermaid season
'Cause I'm swimming in the ocean pleasing
Yeah
