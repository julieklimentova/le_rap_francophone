          
            
            [Verse 1]
These streets are your canvas, baby
Do you know what that means?
This country, it stands upon your
Beautiful colors and dreams
So rest easy and wake up, baby
Be who you wanna be
'Cause we the people are restless, baby
And we the people are free

[Chorus]
So lift up your hands to the pale blue sky
We're unified and I'm lifting mine
Hold tight the hand of the heart that breaks
Stomp down your feet and the ground will shake
Giants, we are giants

[Verse 2]
So have hope and I promise, baby
You will see what I mean
'Cause we the people are restless, baby
And we the people are free

[Chorus]
So lift up your hands to the pale blue sky
We're unified and I'm lifting mine
Hold tight the hand of the heart that breaks
Stomp down your feet and the ground will shake
Giants, we are giants
Giants, we are giants
