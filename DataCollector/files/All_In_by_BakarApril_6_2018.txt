          
            
            [Verse 1]
So embarrassed, so I left for Paris when the bailiffs came
Such a savage, how'd you manage with me? Have my last name
Put you in the palace, living lavish, babe it's not a game
I'm tryna level up, I'm tryna

Put the fork in, feel like my life's been up for auction
Remember when my dreams distorted
That was back when grandma got deported
I'm all in, kid I'm all in

[Chorus]
I'm all in, yeah I'm all in
Be my baby, be my sure thing, you're my sure thing
We were so high now we're falling, now we're falling
Really miss you in the morning, in the morning

I'm all in, yeah I'm all in
Be my baby, be my sure thing, you're my sure thing
We were so high now we're falling, now we're falling
Really miss you in the morning, in the morning

[Verse 2]
They say it ain't true but it works for you
So who'd listen anyway?
Lately, I ain't great, I've been missing you
Hope you come back anyday

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm calling, yeah I'm calling
Know you'll miss me when when I'm touring, when I'm touring
When I'm back home I'm recording, I'm recording
Round in circles, getting boring, getting boring yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I'm all in, yeah I'm all in
Be my baby, be my sure thing, you're my sure thing
We were so high now we're falling, now we're falling
Really miss you in the morning, in the morning

I'm all in, yeah I'm all in
Be my baby, be my sure thing, you're my sure thing
We were so high now I'm falling, now we're falling
Really miss you in the morning, in the morning

I'm all in, yeah I'm all in
Be my baby, be my sure thing, you're my sure thing
We were so high now we're falling, now we're falling
Really miss you in the morning, in the morning

I'm all in, yeah I'm all in
Be my baby, be my sure thing, you're my sure thing
We were so high now we're falling, now we're falling
Really miss you in the morning, in the morning

I'm all in, yeah I'm all in
Be my baby, be my sure thing, you're my sure thing
We were so high now we're falling, now we're falling
Really miss you in the morning, in the morning
