          
            
            [Verse 1]
I got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m not paying the hotel room
And I wanna see Sarah
Smoking blunts in the hotel room
Watching Rick and Morty high
I’m thinking

[Chorus]
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working out

[Verse 2]
Out of this world
But inside of my mind
I do everything I can to walk on the tightrope
Stuck in a paradox
One day I love you
The next day I’m chasing after them like Byron
I can’t fuck you cuz you’re way too beautiful
Beautiful
I don’t love you but I wish I could make love to you
All night long

I got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m thinking

[Chorus]
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working out

[Bridge]
Another day
Another chance to fuck up this whole game
Another day
Another shot to shut their mouth open
Another day
Another hatin’ ass bitch on my way
Another day
Another dilemma rockin’ brown hair

[Verse 3]
Ok, ok, ok
I play with sirens, but this one’s different
We don’t text that much as I’m busy
She knows music’s fueling my silence
I’m not supposed to do what I’m doing
Will I ever give a fuck ‘bout some
Truth been lying ‘bout my direction
It’s gon backfire on my dumb front

I got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m thinking

[Chorus] x2
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working out
