I don't glimmer like you thought I did

Piss on an idol, they don't care anyways
Speaking like I wanna hear you talk about nothing
Fuckers never listen, they always seem to love it
Rocking back n forth to their own howl bumping

I don't waste hate on waste, I manage it
If I was hating you, it could be your privilege
But I don't give a fuck enough to give you all that
I dance to the sound of you squeaking like a rat
Now I've forgotten all about you
See how easy that was for me don't you?
You're nothing to me
None of you
Never knew me because I didn't trust you
