          
            
            [Verse 1]
Wherever you may be, my
Voice will climb up to the sky
On and on
Keep on chanting to the clouds
Since the day you left
Many things could have been said if
If I'd opened my heart to this letter but
Anger is behind me
It's time to move on
It's time for love

[Chorus]
Mother
Oh! Mother!
Mother
Oh! Mother!

[Verse 2]
Summer night breeze
You were stuck in my dreams
Trying to go
I never wanted you to leave
Even if I could not
Hold you back
So much could have things kept away if
If life had decided otherwise
Bitterness is far away now
It's time to move on
It's time for love

[Verse 3]
Wherever you may be
From paradise
You're watching over me
Keep on walking on this land
Surrounded by insanity
I'll be fine
Many things will make you smile, ooh yes
Many things will make you proud, Mother!
Happiness is here
It's time to put it on
It's time for love

[Chorus]
Mother
Oh! Mother!
Mother
Oh! Mother!
