私の黄色りだって？
Will you be my yellow?

[Chorus]
Rain, tears from my eyes, eyes
Pain, feels poltergeist, cry
Sayin, you talk to your God, I
Rain, tears from my eyes, eyes
Pain, feels poltergeist, cry, cry

[Verse]
[?][1:02]
Play, let's play, let’s dance in the rain
Last chance, last chance, Cause time don't wait
Let's play, let’s play, let's dance in the rain
Cause time don't stand, no time don't wait

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we allowed to fall in love?
Are we allowed to fall apart?
Will I ever be enough?
Throwing daggers in the dark

[Chorus]
Rain
Tears from my eyes, my eyes
Pain (Are we allowed to fall in love?)
(Are we allowed to fall apart?)
Feels poltergeist (Will I ever be enough?)
Cry, cry (Throwing daggers in the dark, yeah)
Rain
Tears from my eyes, my eyes
Pain
This pain, feels poltergeist

[Post-Chorus]
Are we allowed to fall in love?
Are we allowed to fall apart?
Will I ever be enough?
Throwing daggers in the dark

[Outro]
Joy, envy
I've seen plenty
Joy, envy
I've seen plenty
