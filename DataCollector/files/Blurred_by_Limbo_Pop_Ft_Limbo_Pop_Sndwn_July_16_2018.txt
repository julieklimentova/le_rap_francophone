          
            
            I can hear you whisper in my ear
Tell me all the things you wanna hear
We could get away from this place
Maybe even go to outer space

Fly across the moon across the stars
Til we forget who we are
Oh I want to get away from this planet
Do you think we could could it

I'm so blurred
You're so blurred
We're so blurred
It's so absurd
Baby I know you like it
Maybe I know I like it
Maybe I know we like it

I can hear you whisper in my ear
Tell me all the things you wanna hear dear
I would follow you into the dark
Walk me down the street into the nearest bar
Kiss me up and down until I can't take it
Babe I've never been one to fake it


I'm so blurred
You're so blurred
We're so blurred
It's so absurd


I can hear you whisper in my ear
Tell me all the things I wanna hear dear
I'm so blurred
You're so blurred
We're so blurred
It's so absurd
