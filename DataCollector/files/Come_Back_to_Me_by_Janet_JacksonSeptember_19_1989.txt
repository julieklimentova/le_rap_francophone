[Verse 1]
Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go

[Chorus]
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
How I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me

[Verse 2]
Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

[Chorus]
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back

[Spoken Interlude]
Please come back to me
I miss you so much
Wherever you are
I love you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go
Not able to let go
No, I won't let you go, no

[Outro]
I don't know what else to say
No, no, no, no
