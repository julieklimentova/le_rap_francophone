          
            
            You want to be where the people are living
You want to live where the life is throbbing
You want a friend who can be your lover
You want a lover who can be your friend
Let's get real, you want a man who can make you feel
The way they make you feel when you feel
Like you can't get through
To every single person that's ever mingled with you
You are alive like a Hollywood car chase
You are the one who has a kiss before the credits
I will be as much to you as I can handle
You're worth every single penny and a few dollars more
I'll be true, I want you and only you
There's nobody else that can do all the things you can do
And after all we've been through there is so much to do

Yes it's true
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Oh yes, you know they do
So I ran away from you
Yes I did, I rode a river of love
It almost took my life, it got so damn rough
It almost threw me overboard, but I held on tight enough
I'd never give up on love

It's when everything is simply disastrous
That our love becomes a beacon of light
And when it all comes together at the end
It makes everything we fought over
Seem that much more trite
God only knows, what the hell we've been fighting for
And all I know is that I need you just like you need me
And that's the way it's gonna stay unconditionally
I'm afraid of all the people crowded 'round my
Life from living with you by my side
You want to catch me swinging back and forth now
My god I hope you won't grow tired of my
Dysfunctional way of existing
I decided it won't be really easy
You gotta trust me when I say thanks for being
The only person who's giving me a break

Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees (yeah they do)
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees (yes they do)
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees
Oh yes, you know they do
So I ran away from you
Yes I did, I rode a river of love
It almost took my life, it got so damn rough
It almost threw me overboard, but I held on tight enough
I never give up on love
No, I'd never give up on love
I wouldn't give up on love
I wouldn't give up on love
I wouldn't give up on love
Not once, not twice, not three times
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
I wouldn't give up on love at all
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
I wouldn't give up on love at all
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
No, I wouldn't give up on love
Your batty lashes, batty lashes got me weak in the knees
Oh yes, you know they do
So I ran away from you, yes I did
I rode a river of love
It almost took my life, it got so damn rough
It almost threw me overboard, but I held on tight enough
I'd never give up on love
No, I'd never give up love
He never gave up, he'd never give up on love
He never gave up, he'd never give up on love
He never gave up, he'd never give up on love
(I never give up)
He never gave up, he'd never give up on love
(I never give up)
On love (x4)

On love
