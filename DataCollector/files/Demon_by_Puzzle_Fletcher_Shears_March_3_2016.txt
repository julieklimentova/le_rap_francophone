          
            
            [Verse 1]
I've got my hands in my thoughts
As a friend simply tried to rearrange
Was that really my vision?
Are you sure if that really was a dream?
Stackin' up bodies
Please escort me from this unfamiliar place
One minute you're flying
But in one blink you could lose your fucking race

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I really think we all are
Cradling this life just like a child
And then you turn your head around
Just in time before you hit the ground
So you think you got it figured out?
Most these people think they're really here
"I got it all planned out for you
Don't worry about it
We're gonna do it step by step
You don't have to worry about me
You could trust me
Trust me, haha"
