          
            
            Hand in hand made a pact, and it stands
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand, ampersand
Wear the band, make it fact, ain't no end
We gon' be the hourglass and the sand, and the sand

Start the whip
Ain't no parts to split
We gon' take it all
Key to lock
That's our partnership
Now we takin' off
Starter kit
'34 deluxe
With the 20 gauge
Hold up, banks, uh
Fill up bags, uh
Money's made

Hate us cause we lived with that money on our mind or
Hate us cause we loved in a way that's hard to find
You could say we're just criminals then take away our lives
But you can't break the symbol 'tween Bonnie & Clyde

Hand in hand made a pact, and it stands
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand, ampersand
Wear the band, make it fact, ain't no end
We gon' be the hourglass and the sand, and the sand
Hand in hand
