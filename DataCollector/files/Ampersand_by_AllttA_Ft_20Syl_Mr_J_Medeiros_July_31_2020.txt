          
            
            Hand in hand made a pact
And it stands
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand
Ampersand
Wear the band make it fact
Ain't no end
We gone be the hour glass and the sand
And the sand

Start the whip ain't no parts to split
We gone take it all
Key to lock thats our partnership
Now we taken off
Starter kit ’34 Deluxe with the 20 gauge
Hold up banks fill up bags money’s made
Hate us cus we lived with that money on our minds
Or hate us cus we loved in a way that’s hard to find
You can say we just criminals then take away our lives
But you can’t break the symbol in Bonnie & Clyde

Hand in hand made a pact
And it stands
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand
Ampersand
Wear the band make it fact
Ain't no end
We gone be the hour glass and the sand
And the sand
Hand in hand made a pact
And it stands
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand
Ampersand
Wear the band make it fact
Ain't no end
We gone be the hour glass and the sand
And the sand

Nothing comes between us but this ampersand
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand

This that kind of love that can’t lose
Cus this that kind of love you can’t choose
When it got your head up over your heels
Only to tie it up in a noose
And you can’t define it in the lines of men
With some kinda piety to prove
No it’s more like the lines within a tigers skin
This is wild and on the move
This is wild and on the moon
Cus there ain't no sun for a dreamer
But there ain't no honey that’s sweeter
With a trunk full of money and heaters
When they coming on the hunt with the media
Gonna find 100 rounds for those magazines
You want our love you got a war
When it’s all about that and between

Hand in hand made a pact
And it stands
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand
Ampersand
Wear the band make it fact
Ain't no end
We gone be the hour glass and the sand
And the sand
Hand in hand made a pact
And it stands
Nothing comes between us but this ampersand
Ampersand
Wear the band make it fact
Ain't no end
We gone be the hour glass and the sand
And the sand
