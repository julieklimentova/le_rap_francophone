          
            
            [Chorus]
Oh no air
You want to take me higher
I know you can

Oh no air
You want to take me higher
I know you can

[Verse One]
I'm going down, down on your lines
I'm lost, I'm lost
I had my eyes wide shut
Never thought I'd feel this way again

[Verse Two]
But my head's so fucking confused
And my heart's so fucking abused
And I think I'm going to lose
I'm in trouble now

[Bridge]
And my necks wrapped up in a noose
And I feel like I am no use
I'm in trouble, I'm in

[Chorus]
Oh no air
You want to take me higher
I know you can

Oh no air
You want to take me higher
