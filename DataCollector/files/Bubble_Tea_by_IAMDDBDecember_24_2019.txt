          
            
            [Verse 1]
Bust down, I need that bust down, bust down (Ooh)
Sippin' on ice and remy (Yeah), all of my shows are sold out
She couldn't believe it, I'm so lit
Picking up all my checks, wanna see you try now
Swear, is it sweeter than the pie now?
Straight when we lie down, we lie down
Yeah, no more pressure in the sky
No depression on my mind, feels like I'm just hypnotised

[Chorus]
Order bubble tea, order bubble tea
Order bubble tea, I like bubble butts
She want all my time but I can't give it up
Ooh, pussy got away, crystals in the sky
Know how to spend your money 'cause a bitch be acting fly
[?] since your ref crossed the line
Yeah, I stay up in my peace, I stay jinky all the time, yeah
(I stay up in my peace) Yeah, it feels okay to know

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm actually global (I'm actually global), still doing tours
Pull up, bust the door, eyes wide open (Yeah)
Came in to see the new styles (Style), I be creeping in the back (Whoa)
Stuck in my mind on the low, I was too broke, I could never go back (Back)
Niggas be talking the low but forget to mention all of the facts (swaggy shit)
Hit my young back with the step, bitch, you know I'm the shit, oh-oh
Bitch, you know (Bitch), only one in control (Bitch)
On the cheque, six zeros (Six zeros), bitch at shows (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Order bubble tea, order bubble tea
Order bubble tea, I like bubble butts
She want all my time but I can't give it up
Ooh, pussy got away, crystals in the sky
Know how to spend your money 'cause a bitch be acting fly
[?] since your ref crossed the line
Yeah, I stay up in my peace, I stay jinky all the time, yeah
(I stay up in my peace) Yeah, it feels okay to know

[Verse 3]
Diva (Yeah) but she a keeper
What would I greet ya? Better than Sheba (Yeah)
While still on a horse on the side, oh (On a horse on the side, oh)
You be skipping on the way back, yeah (Sk-skrrt)
Bitches all on my case, yeah
I know you wanna taste it, you be craving
No invitation (No invitation), who you texting? Ooh
That's the plate, I'm the cherry on the cake (On the cake)

[Chorus]
Order bubble tea, order bubble tea
Order bubble tea, I like bubble butts
She want all my time but I can't give it up
Ooh, pussy got away, crystals in the sky
Know how to spend your money 'cause a bitch be acting fly
[?] since your ref crossed the line
Yeah, I stay up in my peace, I stay jinky all the time, yeah
(I stay up in my peace) Yeah, it feels okay to know
