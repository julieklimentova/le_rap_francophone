I'ma take this shit day by day
I can feel it, man, I'm not okay
Something's wrong, yeah, I gotta say
It's been two weeks since I fucked my main
I can't sleep, got my chest pains
My mind's weak, hope it's just a phase
I ain't sleep in like three days
This morning I counted my blessings
Sat back and taught myself a lessons
It's no more spots for me in Heaven
I met the Devil at 11
Was even nice and bought me presents
Only gave me thirty seconds
If I grab the Smith & Wesson
Will you clean up all the messin'?
Now I'm down to ten seconds
If I make this my profession
Will you make me just the best, yeah?
I really hope I don't regret this
Now I'm down to five seconds
I really hope it's for the best
Really hope it's with a check
And I told him one confession

[Interlude]
But wearin' VV's won't mend things
I got some shooters'll slap you
Thirty on me like I'm Stephen
Thirty on me like I'm Stephen

[Outro]
You know that these bitches just fuck me 'cause I got some hoes ('Cause I got some hoes)
I know that these niggas, they fightin', they tryin' to catch me at shows (Catch me at shows)
These females be actin' like niggas, these niggas be actin' like hoes (Actin' like hoes)
I put it on my mama, let her see my shows
