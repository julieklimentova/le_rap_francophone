          
            
            [Verse 1]
I should've seen this part coming on, coming around the bend
Well I had in my head, great shores
Well I never ever want to feel that way again
Well I'm going down your lies
'Cause I know that way you feel is fine
Well Iknow I'm gonna step into the lights

[Chorus]
When the big smoke comes, I know the way
I want to sail my way home
When the big smoke comes, I know the way
I want to sail my way

[Verse 2]
I've been sitting, waiting, wishing
Thinking about all the time I'm missing
No, I won't be no woman inside the kitchen
Come here darling, I'll cut you loose
Don't you dare try to tell me what to do
Why don't you step into my shoes
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
'Bout me and you
When the big smoke comes, I got to run

[Chorus]
When the big smoke comes, I know the way
I want to sail my way home
When the big smoke comes, I know the way
I want to, I want to sail my way home

[Verse 3]
Try to comfort yourself, with a song
Please don't think you are the only one
'Cause I was done thinking down on myself
Really fucked up, my mental health
Oh, don't you know I speak for myself
Hey, you know the music hits me 'cause I know you feel it too
Oh, so comfortable

[Chorus]
When the big smoke comes, I know the way
I want to sail my way home
When the big smoke comes, I know the way
I want to sail my way home
