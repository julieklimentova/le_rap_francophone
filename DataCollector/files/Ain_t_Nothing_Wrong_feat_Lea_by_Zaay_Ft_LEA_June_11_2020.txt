Bad advice from your friends
Be the reason why we gon end
Cuz you take advice from these women
Who ain't know how to choose men
Im just tryna be honest
Im just being modest
Im the best you ever had
Who could lay it down?
When i come around me, i got the crown
Hope you know i never give it up
Even though i only do the minimum
But im hella eager just to live it up
I say that just to say less
Went away to college
I got hella noggin
You could say i was blessed
And if you happened to ask me
Where my head's at
I probably couldn't even guess

[Hook: Zaay & Lea]

Thought it was love in the beginning
It was lust after all

Ain't nothing wrong if you end up being wrong
Ain't nothing wrong if you end up being wrong X2


[Verse 2: Zaay]

You say i fucked up again
Mistakenly i picked up your call
And thats where you choose to begin
Your advice is we should be friends
But i think your just being dramatic
You got a habit
You act erratic
Its who you are
This who i am
We got this far
Thats for a reason
Broke up plenty times
This time it be the worst
But i did it to myself and thats what hurts
Took your heart up out your chest and put it in a hearse
I be tryna pull up clean but you end up digging dirt
Every time


[Hook: Zaay & Lea]

Thought it was love in the beginning
It was lust after all

Ain't nothing wrong if you end up being wrong
Ain't nothing wrong if you end up being wrong X2
