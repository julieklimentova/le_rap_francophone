          
            
            [Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
I've been playing with a heart like a violin
I've been stumbling through the door after 6 AM
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
Can you help me get away from this life of sin?
I'm ashamed of the dark places I done been
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I was driving through the city, just looking at myself
My conscience telling me that I should just turn this car around
But man, I got these demons and they telling me to go
Further into the night, so the further I go

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm down on my knees, yeah, I'm paranoid
Don't wanna repeat what I did before
I wanna believe that there's something more
I wanna believe

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
I've been playing with a heart like a violin
I've been stumbling through the door after 6 AM
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
Can you help me get away from this life of sin?
I'm ashamed of the dark places I done been
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Through a 100 miles an hour
And the wind is in my hair
But my mouth is just too damn dry to utter out a prayer
And the radio is blasting
Yeah, it's keeping me awake
'Cause I just gotta get back to her before it's just too late

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm down on my knees, yeah, I'm paranoid
Don't wanna repeat what I did before
I wanna believe that there's something more
I wanna believe

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
I've been playing with a heart like a violin
I've been stumbling through the door after 6 AM
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
Can you help me get away from this life of sin?
I'm ashamed of the dark places I done been
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

[Outro]
Hey (Yeah)
Hey (Yeah)
