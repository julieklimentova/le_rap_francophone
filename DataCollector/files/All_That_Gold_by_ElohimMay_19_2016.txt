          
            
            I'ma get you high tonight
All eyes on me, ready to die tonight
So fucked up that you can't drive tonight
We gon' set the whole city on fire tonight
I ain't fall in love yet but yes I like you
Boy I'm the wifey type, not a one nighter
Step into the life of a west side rider
You could spread your wings too but yes I'm flier

Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold
Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold

Chain so big chain so big
Chain so big chain chain so chunky

I'ma get you high tonight
Penthouse suite, put you in the sky tonight
So much gold but there's much more to life
She want them diamonds and them pearls, get your morals right
I just stumbled upon a jackpot
Fell chain down found strength to make the latch pop
Grind time, I turn my crib into the cash spot
Whoever on top, I'm coming for that spot


Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold
Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold

Chain so big chain so big
Chain so big chain chain so chunky
