What did I clearly say?
Children must listen

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No, please!

[WITCH]
What were you not to do?
Children must see
And learn

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No!

[WITCH]
Why could you not obey?
Children should listen
What have I been to you?
What would you have me be?
Handsome like a prince?
Ah, but I am old
I am ugly
I embarrass you

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No!

[WITCH]
You are ashamed of me

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No!

[WITCH]
You are ashamed
You don't understand

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I am no longer a child. I wish to see the world

[WITCH]
Don't you know what's out there in the world?
Someone has to shield you from the world
Stay with me
Princes wait there in the world, it's true
Princes, yes, but wolves and humans, too
Stay at home
I am home
Who out there could love you more than I?
What out there that I cannot supply?
Stay with me
Stay with me
The world is dark and wild
Stay a child while you can be a child
With me

(spoken)
I gave you protection, and yet you disobeyed me

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No -

[WITCH, spoken]
Your prince will never lay eyes on you again. He will never lay eyes on anything again

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
What did you do to him?

[WITCH, spoken]
It doesn't matter. Because where you're going, no one will ever see you again!

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No!
