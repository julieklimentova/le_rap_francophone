          
            
            [Verse 1]
Speak that into existence
All I really need is a vision
All I really need is persistence
And never to believe that you get it in an instant
Add a grain of salt to everybody’s opinion
4th and long is really 4th and inches
Stay creating and stay consistent
Find out failure is really non existent
You get the things you think will make you happy
Find out later they were insufficient
Often where you wanna be is on the other side of fear
But you still keep your distance
Post a song on the internet
I’m just hoping I could get some one to listen
Often times it falls on deaf ears
And I fall asleep to the sound of crickets

[Chorus]
Chirp-chirp
Hmm yeah who putting in the work-work
Huh dang yea chirp-chirp
Who putting in the work-work
Pardon my pain
I been in the mazes lately
Starting my way
I think it’s gonna take some patience

[Verse 2]
Sit back with a Kit-kat
Nah I’m playin’ I don’t take breaks
They say what they say
I’m not worried about the nay say’s
Make way why you trying to make waves
Work week looking like eight days
I could really use a va-cay
Studio is my safe place
On a roll like I get great grades
No I don’t mind
If I’m criticized
I only listen to words that are wise
What do they want, a piece of the pie
They wanna fill up just what’s eats them inside
We eat to survive to keep us alive
Your heart is so cold you keep freezing the time
Stuck in the past stuck in rewind
One of my hundreds of reasons to try

[Chorus]
Chirp-chirp
Hmm yeah who putting in the work-work
Huh dang yea chirp-chirp
Who putting in the work-work
Pardon my pain
I been in the mazes lately
Starting my way
I think it’s gonna take some patience
