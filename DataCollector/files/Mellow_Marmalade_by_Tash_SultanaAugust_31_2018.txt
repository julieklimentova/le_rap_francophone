          
            
            [Verse 1]
I seep sourly into the depths of my mind
And I find my sorriness so very hard to define
I got my soul all twisted tangled in a noose so
When the good outweighed the bad I said
"Oh hell what's the use?"
'Cause I keep skipping stones
Like a child with broken bones
And my mother always told me
"You gotta leave your bags at the door"

[Pre-Chorus]
But I didn't wanna talk it through
Say things I don't give a fuck about
No, I didn't want to be next to you
I was feeling sorry for myself
And I like, I like, I like, I like my eggs sunny side up
Is that a problem with you?
'Cause I don't wanna live my life without you

[Chorus]
So, baby girl, why don't we slow it down?
And don't go walking away from me, right now
So, baby girl, why don't we slow it down?
And don't go walking away from me

[Verse 2]
Call it lady marmalade
Yellow mellow
The way you touched my soul was so damn evil
Oh, can you tell me what is that song?
I heard it playing on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
But I didn't wanna talk it through
Say things I don't give a fuck about
No, I didn't wanna be next to you
Cause I was feeling sorry for myself
And I like, I like, I like, I like my eggs sunny side up
Is that a problem with you?
And no, I don't carry on living my life with a pessimistic view

[Chorus]
So, baby girl, why don't we slow it down?
And don't go walking away from me right now, right now
So, baby girl, why don't we slow it down?
And don't go, don't go, don't, don't, don't, don't go
Walking away from me, from me, from me
From, from me
