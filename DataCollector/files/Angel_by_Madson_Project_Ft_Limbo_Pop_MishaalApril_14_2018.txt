          
            
            If you were an angel
I wouldn't be surprised
By the way you kiss me
It heals my soul

If you were angel
I wouldn't be surprised
By your smile
You are so fine

If I was an angel
We could fly away up so high
With no one else I'd swear It'd be just you and I
Through the clouds, over the sun that shines so bright

And if I was an angel
You'd know right away
'Cause you have the same wings
And I've seen your halo ring

I don't wanna fall in love
With no other
You are the one that
I decide to go further
Further than the sun

All my life I've been searching
For a meaning
I didn't know that you were
The sense of my mess
Of my mess

If you were an angel
I wouldn't be surprised
By the way you keep me
High in love

If you were an angel
I wouldn't be surprised
By your smile
You are so fine
