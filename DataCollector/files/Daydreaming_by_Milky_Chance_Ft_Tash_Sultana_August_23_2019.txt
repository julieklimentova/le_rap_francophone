          
            
            [Verse 1: Clemens Rehbein]
A hundred days, I don't wanna see
During day, I just can't believe
Where did that go? I need to know the deepest blame
I get sucked in, thinking of the sea

[Chorus: Clemens Rehbein]
I talk to you
With my head up in the clouds
See the light shining through
Might be the moon
Giving way throughout the night, through the night
When I'm daydreaming
When I'm daydreaming

[Verse 2: Tash Sultana]
Maybe we're just passin' through
Two souls venturin' into the moon
The life before, whoever really know?
Speak a different point of view
Common ground, flowers bloom
Pink, yellow, red, and blue
Make it through the meadow
Make it oh so simple, so simple

[Chorus: Clemens Rehbein with Tash Sultana]
I talk to you
With my head up in the clouds
See the light shining through
Might be the moon
Giving way throughout the night, through the night
When I'm daydreaming
When I'm daydreaming

[Outro: Clemens Rehbein & Tash Sultana]
Might be the moon
When I'm daydreaming
When I'm daydreaming
When I'm daydreaming
When I'm daydreaming
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
