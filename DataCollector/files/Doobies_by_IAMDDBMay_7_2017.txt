IAMDDB
Big up Khadu on production (That's what I say, that's what I say)
(That's what I say, that's what I say)

I keep it G of course (I keep it G of course)
I keep it G of course (I keep it G of course)
I keep it G of course (I keep it G of course)
The only way (Only way)
The right way (The right way)
The real way (The real way)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I keep it G, that's what I say
I keep it G at all times, that's what I say
And if you can't I suggest you keep movin' away, away
That's what I say
I keep it G at all times, that's what I say
This is real life, the only way we play (The way we play)
The right way (The right way)
The real way (The real way)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Used to complain but now I run things in my own way
Never looking back 'cause I don't need to, I'm not lonely
No way, it's too late, no foreplay
'Cause I just sit inside, smoke my doobies, get high and look in my mind
Normally, constructively I can find some knowledge in my soul hidden in my heart
Pouring out my heart this will never add up to the price I pay when I speak my mind

[Chorus]
We keep it G at all times, that's what I say (That's what I say)
And if you can't I suggest you keep movin' away, away
That's what I say, we keep it G at all times, that's what I say
This is real life, the only way we play
The right way, the real way, the only way

[Verse 2]
Take me through your mind, take me through your mind and let me
See what I can find, see what I can find 'cause I
Really wanna know what is under your soul
'Cause I just sit inside, smoke my doobies, get high and look in my mind
Normally, constructively I can find some knowledge in my soul hidden in my heart
Pouring out my heart will never add up to the price I pay when I speak my mind
When I speak my mind, to the price I pay when I speak my mind, ay
Urban jazz fo' yo ass
Keep it G (Keep it G)
If you wanna be gang gotta keep it G (Gotta keep it G)
Normally and constructively elevating
Come, I'll set you free

[Outro]
It's mermaid season, yeah, ah (Yeah, I keep it G)
Ooh, lil bitch
