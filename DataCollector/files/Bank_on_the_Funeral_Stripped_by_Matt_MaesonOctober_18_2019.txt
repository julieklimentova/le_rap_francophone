          
            
            [Verse 1]
I bank on the funeral
'Cause I learned all my lessons that way
I chipped from my heaven sent
Until I stole everything that I made

[Chorus]
And this millstone is heavy as hell
And I can't see so well
And I still feel the swell
And my hands and my feet are expelled
Better dead than in hell
And again with the swell

[Verse 2]
I bank on the funeral
'Cause the truth is alive is okay
The salt was in other words
More flavorful in those days

[Chorus]
And this millstone is heavy as hell
And I can't see so well
And I still feel the swell
And my hands and my feet are expelled
Better dead than in hell
And again with the swell

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Oh, and lesson learned could sell
Better dead than in hell
Oh, and lesson learned could sell
Better dead than in hell
Oh, and lesson learned could sell
Better dead than in hell
