I just fell in love with the Codeine
They see me out in public and they know me
Your girl blowin my phone up when she lonely
They see me out in public, they know me
They know me
Everybody Know me
Thinking like her friend you waiting lowkey
They know me
Everybody know me
See me out in public and they know me

[Verse: Prince Mula]
Stackin money and I'm flexin like I rock Balmain
I count the racks and sum it but you can't do the same
Let's get it poppin that designer bottle champagne
The diamonds dancing and they drippin on my gold chain
Couple karats on ya wrist, makes a full mill
I spent a couple on my neck so its a good deal
This ain't dramatic but I'm plottin' on some Gangsta Grillz
But I ain't putting em in my teeth unless I know its real
I gots myself a little queen, she a princess
And she be poppin' in that sparkle black and gold dress
She even finer with no makeup in some bummy sweats
But when the summer come around, she around less

[Hook: Christian Radke]

[Verse: Prince Mula]
I see the finer things, lookin from my clear view
The 2 seater got me lookin in the rearview
I know when loving came around you was fearful
But then the feeling when away when I was with you
And now we on the highest level drippin in the sauce
I'm tryina get my dollars up, livin like a boss
The shit we rock its gotta better be that dental floss
I'll get your nails matching on ya favorite lip gloss
And I know they say money never buy hapiness
But trust me baby I been dressing like a champion
Your favorite color is that brand that your sweater says
Get you a couple I be spending like a leattuce head

They know me
Everybody know me
See me out in public and they know me

[Bridge: Prince Mula]
I just fell in love with the Codeine
I'm sippin' outta cup full of that muddy
Swimming through the cash like its chlorine
Fuck a check I be spending all my money

[Hook: Christian Radke]
