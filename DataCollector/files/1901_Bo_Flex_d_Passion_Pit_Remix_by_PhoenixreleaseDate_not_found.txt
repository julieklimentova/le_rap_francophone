          
            
            [Verse 1]
Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present, they don't matter now the future's sorted out
Watch her move in elliptical patterns
Think it's not what you say, what you say is way too complicated
For a minute, though, I couldn't tell how to fall out

[Chorus]
It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
Calling hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it all the summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
It's not a miracle we needed
No, I wouldn't let you think so

[Post-Chorus]
Folded, folded, folded, folded
Folded, folded, folded, folded

[Verse 2]
Girlfriend, oh, your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present, 1855, 1901
Watch them build up a meteor tower
Think it's not gonna stay anyway, I think it's overrated
For a minute, though, I couldn't tell how to fall out

[Chorus]
It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
Calling hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it all the summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
It's not a miracle we needed
No, I wouldn't let you think so

[Post-Chorus]
Folded, folded, folded, folded
Folded, folded, folded, folded
Folded, folded, folded, folded
Folded, folded, folded, folded
