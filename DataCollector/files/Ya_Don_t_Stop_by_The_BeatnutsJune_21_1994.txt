You don't stop, you keep on!

[Verse 1: JuJu]
It's the Junkyard nigga, kid, you know what I'm about
Puffing on a fat one, guzzling a Guinness Stout
Boning bitches on a regular
My game is lethal, that's my word, I'm telling ya
Living foul like a motherfucker
That's the way it's been ever since I was a shorty, sucker
So don't even try to flex
I'll put a round in your chest and leave you in a fucking mess
Niggas know my style, they be playing
If I have to catch a body I will, know what I'm saying?
Niggas from Corona don't be having it
You put your face in my grill I'll be stabbing it
You fuck around and catch a bad one
I'll kill you like a six-pack and put you in a bag, son
And I still ain't fronting
Fully loaded Tec, chump, ready to go hunting

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Psycho Les]
I come equipped with shit that's fucking wicked
Damn, niggas can't fuck with the program
I take a stand and look down the clip
Take a swig and spark up the spliff (boom!)
Niggas know the time with the Beatnuts funk
John Wayne got smoked when I popped the trunk
Punk, I told you once and I won't tell you twice
I smoke the blunts and we won't pay the price
For pussy or any fucking mass
But the raw dog style in your girl's ass
(Ho, ooh!) I think I just came
Stud's break didn't work, I guess it's all in your brain
Shit smells like demon spirit
Learn from Exorcist, punk, you can't come near it
So fear it or you'll go out like the priest
Don't you know, man I'm the wicked nigga from the East Coast

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fashion]
Ooh child, motherfuckers down with the licks
Oh shit, I'm hitting niggas sick with my tricks
So throw up styles that blow up whiles I go
On with the flow, better act like you know
But I won't take no prisoners, got shit for his-n-hers
Fucks up you all when the nuts have a ball
Cause we don't play, blast brains with the smoker
Get fucked up when we toke with the joker
And, never let me see you crying
Heads start to flying, it's time for the dying
And I'mma get real deep, fall into a sleep
Knock a freak in my sheets, man, fuck counting sheep
And come on, step on up and meet my Tec
Either fill you full of wholes, or wring your fucking neck
Cause I'mma let off and blast a shot in your eye
Make way motherfucks, it's the real superfly
