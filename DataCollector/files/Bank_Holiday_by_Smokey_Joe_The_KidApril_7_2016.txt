I'll go to the bank in the morning
I was figuring you'd pay me off tonight
They don't keep cash like that in the hotel
OK, well let's go out and have a drink
Ah, why not?
I'll lock up, Eddie
I can't go with you?
That's just what I mean
You're a drunken old fool
[?]
Now don't you worry about Eddie
Oh are you coming or not?
Yeah, I'm coming...

[Verse 1]
At last it's summer
I returned to gather
The aquatic flowers
Stumbling over the same polished pebbles
Where we had tread together
I was alone, your image close
To me, and I...
Where we had tread together
I was alone, your image close
To me, and I have to confess
I miss you

[Verse 2]
Crying soft tears
Even though my heart is happy
Crying soft tears
My heart is happy it will be my secret
My heart is happy it will be my secret
My heart is happy it will be my secret
Tender in silence

[Verse 3]
At last it's summer
I returned to gather
The aquatics flowers
The aquatics flowers
Stumbling over the same polished pebbles
Where we had tread together
I was alone, your image close to me
And I have to confess I miss you
I'll say nothing, I'll stay like like this
Crying soft tears
