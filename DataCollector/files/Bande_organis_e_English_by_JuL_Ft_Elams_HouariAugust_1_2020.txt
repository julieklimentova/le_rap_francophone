          
            
            [Verse 1: SCH]
Yes, my spoiled one, RS4 gray nardo, of course they missed me (big, of course)
Sun in the bubble, on the Prado, Shifter pro '(Shifter pro')
Wrong (ah), my darling, you’re wrong
Puta, where were you when I put in seven euros in gasoline (eh)?
You want to make war on us (eh)? By God, it's B (ah)
It takes your Audi, it takes your gadji, it takes your credit card (eh, eh)
The phone beeps (brr), you take the kew (ew)
It's Marseille, baby (ah), his mother a CDD (ah)
Wesh thеn, my race, quiet or what? (oh, mathafack)
Climb in the tchop, I do zеro to one hundred in two seconds three
Guitarized, oh, AC / DC, oh, we cross paths, for sure, you are paralyzed


[Verse 2: Kofs]
I passed the ring to Tchikita, two months later, I already left her (ah, ah)
You're a little bastard, I'm a Nabba, I'm a Diakité (eh)
I'm the captain (eh), I'm going to behead them (eh)
It's not the capital (nan), it's Marseille, baby (pah, pah, pah)
1.3, Audi Sport, I go through customs, the reports
Fuck your mother on the Canebière, fuck your dead on the Old Port (Health & Happiness)
Mi amor, it's the South districts, it's the North districts
Fuck your mother on the Canebière, fuck your dead on the Old Port (ah)


[Verse 3: JuL]
I'm in the zone, without a helmet on a kit-é scooter
Forget her, she's a puta, she left you
I'm elsewhere, it is from the moula that I crumbled
From then on time, that it fucked me up my lighter
Burst, flow bazookaw, I have friends who move in case
The bike, it goes "brm, brm, brm, brm", always there, ask Tchyco
I'm in the tap dance game, tracksuit '
I fuck the crazy women who talk about me on the net
I'm on potion there, I shoot two-three on the pet '
By the way, we climb, send the zeros on the Czech
Ah, ah, buddy, what happened? Ah, ah, in your head?
Ah, ah, grr, ratata, ah, ah, for the mapesa
Ah, ah, buddy, what happened? Ah, ah, in your head?
Ah, ah, grr, ratata, ah, ah, for the mapesa
No need to go to Lacoste anymore since I'm made of gold and platinum
And on Twitter, I see their posts, fuck their mothers those who speak badly about the team


[Chorus: JuL & Solda]
In an organized band, no one can channel us
In the area, it smokes the rocket, tracked by the undercover
See you later, make one, see you later, make two
See you later, ooh, ooh, see you later, bam, bam


[Verse 4: Naps]
It's 24 karat (nah), I've been raping since the days of K-Ra
The technique, the sick flow, artistically, we walk around (ok)
T-Max, Araï helmet, wanted in Kech-Marra
I send him an unstoppable strike, I ruin her mascara (ah, ah)
The J is the S (ok), hum, I'm pulling out the RS (vroum, vroum)
A thick bundle, Arlabelek, N.A.P.S (ah, ah)
The, the J, it's the S (ok), um, I'm pulling out the RS (vroum, vroum)
A thick wad, Arlabelek, N.A.P.S (ok)


[Verse 5: Soso Maness]
Yo, stop your spiel (yeah), you're just a bar son (ah)
I start rap with 7 and 3, at the river, I hit the fifth
Yo, I'm aiming for gold, platinum (ah), at the base, it was the foundations
I'm a bit of Zampa, a bit of Zizou (suddenly), I offer a Ricard to Poutine
Young building smuggler, run like Usain Bolt (ah, ah)
I know the handling of my department, in the evening, to offend you '(ah, ah, ah)
And it goes: zumba, caféw, caféw, carnival
J'suis dans l'4x4 teinté, pisté par la banal'
Et ça fait : zumba, caféw, caféw, carnaval
J'suis dans l'4x4 teinté, pisté par la banal'

[Chorus: JuL & Solda]
In an organized band, no one can channel us
In the area, it smokes the rocket, tracked by the undercover
See you later, make one, see you later, make two
See you later, ooh, ooh, see you later, bam, bam


[Verse 6: Elams]
Equal, illegal (eh), Alpha, Omega (vroum)
We do coup, bullet in the te-tê, it's the cuenta (vroum)
Pursuit, there are the blues (blue), serene, I'm coming out of the blue (blue)
Ter-ter, front sight, logistics, on the ground, blood, ballistics
A-tchu-tchu-tcha (tcha), it's a salvatrucha ('cha)
Traffic haram (ah), Marseille, we find corpses (yeah)
Marseille hala, no more soul, the little ones take action (yeah)
Milli ', I want the milli' like the UFO (hum), these filha puta, I finish them


[Verse 7: Solda]
Yah, we make them friends: enemies, yah, we make them enemies: friends, yah
My pockets are full, you follow me, I did the math plus calculate him, yah (ouh)
Behavior in the zone, yah, behave with men, yah
Keep fishing, me, I have the shape, shape, temenik, we deform you
Because it's too true, you have a bad look and a bad background, when I'm having fun, you are remade (eh)
In bed, you're bad (eh), your gadji, we know her (eh, eh)
In the parlor, she turned (eh, eh), banged by prisoners (ouh, ouh)
You owe money, money, money, you do the mala in the "boom, boom, boom"
For change, we click, click, boom, alcohol, we glo, glo, glo (glo, glo, glo)
You owe money, money, money, you do the mala in the "boom, boom, boom"
For change, we click, click, boom, alcohol, we glo, glo, glo (glo, glo, glo)


[Verse 8: Houari]
Wesh, you don't want war but why are you lighting the wick (wick, wick)?
I'm in the area, I avoid the putas, wesh
Me, I don't listen to people and my Clio, it's on the rims
I do that smoke yellow, sometimes, with a little Marie-Jeanne
Yesterday, I was blue, I wanted a blue Porsche GT (blue)
There was bread, we were full, there was not one, we were two (two)
I'm in the block, my doe, in the area, it's each his kich '(his kich')
There were traitors, traitors, traitors, fuck his mother, it's nothing, ma3lich
In the neighborhood, there is the sale of weapons, new pair, I pay in cash
Do belek, there are the gendarmes, they are far away, it's good, distress
It's all for la plata, flashback, fumar mata (brh)
It dances as a team to the song of the "ratata"

[Chorus: JuL & Solda] (x2)
In an organized band, no one can channel us
In the area, it smokes the rocket, tracked by the undercover
See you later, make one, see you later, make two
See you later, ooh, ooh, see you later, bam, bam
