          
            
            [Verse 1]
My own reflection's making me sick
I've been this way since my faith quit

[Refrain]
And I never asked for this pain
It's taking me over
It's taking me over
It's making me colder (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I broke it, would you quit?
Is this heartache we could fix?
In the morning, when we wake
When I'm sober, would you stay?
If I broke it, would you quit?
Is this heartache we could fix?
In the morning, when we wake
When I'm sober

[Chorus]
Please just go easy on me, baby
Go easy on me, baby
Can you understand it?
I can't keep living for the damage
Please just go easy on me, baby
Go easy on me, baby
Can you understand it?
I can't keep living for the damage (Oh)

[Verse 2]
My own deception is moving too quick
I tried to love and I lost it

[Refrain]
And I never wanted to change
It's taking me over
It's taking me over
It's making me colder (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I broke it, would you quit?
Is this heartache we could fix?
In the morning, when we wake
When I'm sober, would you stay?
If I broke it, would you quit?
Is this heartache we could fix?
In the morning, when we wake
When I'm sober

[Chorus]
Please just go easy on me, baby
Go easy on me, baby
Can you understand it?
I can't keep living for the damage
Please just go easy on me, baby
Go easy on me, baby
Can you understand it?
I can't keep living for the damage (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me
I know love
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me
I know love
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me
I know love
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me
I know love (Love)
I know love

[Chorus]
Please just go easy on me, baby
Go easy on me, baby
Can you understand it?
I can't keep living for the damage
Please just go easy on me, baby
Go easy on me, baby
Can you understand it?
I can't keep living for the damage (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me
I know love
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me (I know love)
I know love
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me
I know love
Can't change me, can't save me, can't blame me (I know love)
I know love
