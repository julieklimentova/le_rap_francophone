          
            
            [Verse 1]
Pause all these words
Pause all these words that we keep aiming with
Who said it first? Who said it first? Let's not go down like this
Take your pain, take all of the emotions that you feel
Give 'em all to me

[Chorus]
Oh, I-I-I, I wanna get lost in the night now
Hold me in the dark, turn the lights down
And give me your electric touch
Oh, I-I-I, I don't wanna think about the distance
I just wanna be in your existence
So give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh

[Verse 2]
Oh, all the things, remember all the things we used to do
Give in to me, give in to me and I'll give in to you
If you need it, oh if you need to win, then I can lose
If it brings me back to you

[Chorus]
Oh, I-I-I, I wanna get lost in the night now
Hold me in the dark, turn the lights down
And give me your electric touch
Oh, I-I-I, I don't wanna think about the distance
I just wanna be in your existence
So give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh
