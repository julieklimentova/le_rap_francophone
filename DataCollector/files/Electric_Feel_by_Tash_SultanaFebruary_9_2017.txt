          
            
            [Verse 1]
All along the Western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running through her skin

[Refain]
Standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

[Chorus]
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel"
Oh—o—oh, I said, "Oo, baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
Oh—o—oh, I said, "Oo, baby girl
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, hey, hey, yeah
Turn me on with your electric feel"

[Verse 2]
All along the Eastern shore
Put your circuit in the sea
Oh, this is what the world is for
Making electricity
Oh, you can feel it in your mind
Oh you can do it all the time

[Refain]
Standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

[Chorus (Condensed)]
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, hey, hey, yeah
Turn me on with your electric feel"

[Chorus (Extended)]
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Oh—o—oh, I said, "Oo, baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
Oh—o—oh, I said, "Oo, oo
Oo, oo, girl
Shock me like an electric eel"
I said, "Oo—oo—oo—oo—oo—oo—oo—oo—oo—oo
Baby girl, hey, hey, yeah
Why don't you die
[?] feel [?]
