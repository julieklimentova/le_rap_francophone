          
            
            [Chorus]
Tell me what's the deal
What's the deal, what's the deal now (Yeah)
'Cause I just wanna chill
Wanna chill, wanna chill now
Tell me what's the deal
What's the deal, what's the deal now (Yeah)
'Cause I just wanna chill
Wanna chill, wanna chill now (Brr, brr, woo!)

[Verse 1]
I've been in the field now
And you've been popping pills now
I told you that's no good for you (No)
You hate when I tell you what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate it when I tell the truth
I just wanna feel with you
Why you make it long for me?
Hate it when I tell the truth
I just wanna chill with you
Why you make it long for me?

[Chorus]
Tell me what's the deal
What's the deal, what's the deal now (Yeah)
'Cause I just wanna chill
Wanna chill, wanna chill now
Tell me what's the deal
What's the deal, what's the deal now (Yeah)
'Cause I just wanna chill
Wanna chill, wanna chill now

[Verse 2]
I've been feeling good now
Still misunderstood now
Tryna make my hood proud
'Member when they wouldn't even 'llow us in
Many doubted him
But she never, she was there
'Cause she proud of him
And I never even cared, 'cause I'm cowardly
So why don't you tell me the deal now?

[Refrain]
Tell me what's the deal now
I just wanna chill now
Tell me what's the deal now
I just wanna chill now
Tell me what's the deal now (Tell me what's the deal now)
(I just wanna chill now) I just wanna chill now
(Tell me what's the deal with you)
(Tell me what's the deal now) Tell me what's the deal now
(I just wanna chill now) I just wanna chill now
Tell me what's the deal with you
Yeah
Tell me what's the deal now
I just wanna chill now
Tell me what's the deal with you (Yeah)
Tell me what's the deal now
I just wanna chill now

[Verse 3]
Rest in peace to Amy
Wish she had a daughter
Wish she would've had my baby
Wish we had a long run
[?] used to drive you crazy
I wish we could go back
I've been overthinkin' lately
Seven days, I'm on one
On one, on one, on one
Sellin' dreams I'm on one, yeah
On one, on one, on one
Seven days, I'm on one
