          
            
            [Verse 1]
When I think about it, our love's rouge
My love comes seeping through
You know that I get lost without you
When I don't make no sense, no, no sense
And if we follow then you'll find it
You meet me in the maze
In the place beyond the pine
In the place we always wait
And if you be kind, little darlin', then our love's fantasy
And all that fightin', all that hidin', don't mean shit to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I let your love forsake me like nobody else
And I want your arms to take me like nobody else
Ooh, I need you to save me
'Cause I can't save myself
You know, you know, you know

[Verse 2]
We've been on the phone talkin' late at night
Tellin' me to come over
Try to have some space, you leave me to your state
You give me the cold shoulder
You know I don't appreciate when you get down on yourself like that
Cotton candy, life's so dandy
Play another song
Hardly coping, oh, I was jokin', oh, it just goes on
And on and on and on and on
Let me get some quiet to myself

[Bridge]
Let me, let me, let me
Get some quiet to myself
Come on, come on
Save me from myself

[Chorus]
'Cause I let your love forsake me like nobody else
And I want your arms to take me like nobody else
Ooh, I need you to save me
'Cause I can't save myself
You know, you know, you know

[Outro]
I cannot save my–
I cannot save myself
I cannot save my–
I cannot save myself
I cannot save my–
I cannot save myself
