Yeah, IAMDDB
Didn't you already know?

[Verse 1]
Tickling through my mind
I find somethings that I cannot hide
In my inner self (In my inner self)
Calling for my own help
Tickling through my mind
I find feelings that I will not hide, yeah
Growth in me, confide in me
Come close to me, yeah
Never harming things (Never harming things)
Stay in harmony (Stay in harmony)
Content in myself
'Cause I just keep on riding
Ride or die, keep on grinding
Crying, crying, I'm gon' drow, ayy
By myself, on my own, all alone
But I'm still in control
I could go all night long, yeah
(keep it G of course)

[Chorus]
My energies
Is this my destiny?
I want to see, I need to feel
What I feel, what I know
But I cannot breathe
This is incredibly intense for me
It's killing me
Oh, yes, it's killing me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I try to find the answers in my heart, yeah
Somewhere between the scars, uh
I can not see what happened to me
I'm just tryna be me
Pick myself up
Throw yourself down
Never give up on us
'Cause we are so far from them, from them
'Cause there's no replacing you, my friend
I cannot describe the way I feel
When I remember that our love is real, yeah
Whenever I remember that I love you still (I love you still)
Keep it G at all times, thatâ€™s the deal, yeah

[Chorus]
My energies
Is this my destiny?
I want to see, I need to feel
What I feel, what I know
But I cannot breathe
This is incredibly intense for me
It's killing me
Oh, yes, it's killing me, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, yes, it's killing me, yeah
Always I'm killing me, no
It didn't have to be this way, uh
But I did it anyway, no
In my mind (In my mind)
Tickling in my mind, yeah
In my mind, yeah (In my mind)
Tickling through my mind all the time
In my mind all the time
In my mind
IAMDDB, keep it G of course, yeah
