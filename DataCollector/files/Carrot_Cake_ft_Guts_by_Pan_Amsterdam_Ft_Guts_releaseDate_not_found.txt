          
            
            My girl dressed like a girl

Cowboy hats boots and Spanish pearls

I see on both sides like Chapelle, See on both sides like Chapelle

The daily planet writes me up well

Hint, Clark Kent slipped and fell

I be the new son of Jor-El

Clean your nose with my new lapel

Flying twice as high with no butterflies in the sky

OD’d and an alibi

Rainbows can’t read and Lavare can’t see

Sue me I’m a trekkie

So dated and rehearsed

And fashionably late

Ill funk likе rotten milk and past the expiration datе

It’ll make your granny’s cow lactate

Thus old rugs levitate

You’ll wonder why I got apple pie prune juice and carrot cakes

Silly wabbit trix are for kids and I only watch R-rated vids

On VHS blue neon grids

Did you shoot Bambi? Yes you did

Don’t worry I won’t tell a soul, underground like Alice in a rabbit hole

Please there’s no need to text us, eaves drop on you like Alexa

(Come in closer)

Thought it was Wonderland

Data sent to Amazon shamans

Bossa Nova, you a boss huh?

Now you’re deep in the woods on Ayahuasca

(Come in closer)

Burn me out the forest when you’re more harrier than Chuck Norris

Try to control my fate? I'll have a talk with your mum after I’m done with the carrot cake

I’m gonna beat them in the coliseum

A cat will be the witness of my outstanding fitness

Shuffling on em like Ali

Then he'll try to shuffle like me, what a sight to see

(Come in closer)

Because I don’t fight I eat chips and watch a lotta kung fu flicks

Way of the dragon be my profile pic

Fell off the wagon by Daniel’s crane style kick

(Come in closer)

Guts on the beat, we go slumming in Paris throwing daggers at feet

We put the crowd into a sweat lodge dried saliva with a tinge of fromage

Collage clay-mation and paper maches

Duchamp this scene like Claude Monet

PO Box number collect cache

Prefer vin rouge to pink rose

I’m topless so you ain’t top of nothing

Spotless in a junk yard eatin’ muffins

A little yeasty

Put it back in the oven

BBQ play trumpet like Kermit Ruffins
