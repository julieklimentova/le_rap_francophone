          
            
            I did it for the challenge, always close to tumblin’
I can’t believe I’m almost done man what a battle and
The worst is yet to come as I did deviated plans
He’s knocking in the studio since #46 I’m late
It’s bigger than the music, weirder than the Piri Reis
It’s been 268 weeks I’m obsessed with it
So let’s say whatever the fuck will happen, will happen
Amiran for the trick, and damn I’m really feeling no regrets

OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon hurt you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon kill you for your guts
Fight it like a champion

And I jumped off the cliff, landed in Maïa’s hands
If I had to start all over, I would do it again
Cuz I, live with no regrets, no doubt, no I wish I did
When Rilèsundayz is done, it’s gon be the beginning
Try to test me
Thrill me
Not a lot impress me
Love me
Hate me
‘Least you won’t forget me
Curse me
Bless me
I’m already blasted
It took me lot of years of training
And I will no waste them
Westside, Indies
All my people listening
Mix it
Bounce it
Talk with the quality
Drugs & dark rings
I’m awake since last week
Cautions, warnings
Should I pay attention

OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon hurt you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon kill you for your guts
Fight it like a champion

Stunting on your traps, gave a lotta indications
Somedays I which I could tape yo lips so watch & remain silent
It’s gon be the end on time, if time’s allowing me to finish
Wanna guess the words I’ll say
But you won’t find the tale into ‘em
You won’t give in to
Numerous favors
I know it’s hard to
Live like a hermit
All those sacrifices
It was worth it
Last but not least
So end it with style and

OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon hurt you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon kill you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
