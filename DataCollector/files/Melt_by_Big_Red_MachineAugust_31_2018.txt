And you're having a laugh
With nothing beseeched
You got no kind of map

So just follow your feet
With your heart in your mouth
And your boring that Peet
Are you hot on the couch?
And you're blowing through pouches

Well, you are who you are

Well, you are who you are
Well, you are who you are

Well, you want it to keep
So you stay on your sea
Well, you know it's a Scene

Well, I know it's a struggle
It's some kind of debacle

It's some kind of debacle
Well, I know it's a struggle
It's some kind of debacle
Well, I know it's a struggle

You fancy your feast
But you dreading your speech
Just follow your feet
