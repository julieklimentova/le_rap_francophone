          
            
            It's the prison break anthem, prison break anthem
Just what you need, just what you need

There's a story about a man, they'd be puttin´ down
Some real shit, his brother locked up right now
Penitentiary Illinois, out of town
Death row´s just fucked up now
Jailed down by the government in a couple of weeks
To survive his brother he needs
He gotta prove that he´s innocent it is hard on the streets
That's why he can't accept defeat

He ain't a hustler good guy, Intelligent that's why;

(Prison break anthem)
You know what I'm talking about
He ain't a hustler good guy, Intelligent that's why

(prison break anthem, prison break anthem)

(chorus)
Okay; It's the prison break anthem, prison break anthem
Just what you need, just what you need
Brother locked up, freedom it's over now
I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm making it happen
Prison break anthem, prison break anthem
Just what you need, just what you need
My brother locked up, freedom it's over now
I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm making it happen

Convicted for murder first degree
Let's praise to the lord. Now set me free
I'm on parole now, what do you want now?
Black, white, any colour let's go now
2 Years 6 Months in cell four O

(whisper: Prison break anthem, anthem,anthem)
2 Years 6 Months in cell four O

(whisper: Prison break anthem, anthem,anthem)

(chorus)

(whisper: prison break anthem, prison break anthem)
It's the prison break anthem, prison break anthem
Just what you need, just what you need
Brother locked up, freedom it's over now
I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm making it happen
Prison break anthem, prison break anthem
Just what you need, just what you need
My brother locked up, freedom it's over now
I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm making it happen

(whisper: prison break anthem, prison break anthem)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Michael Scofield, the greatest kick, the clock is ticking...
Prison break
Lincoln Burrows; Break in break out. Bloodline are familiar with what it´s about
A promise to reveal, pieces to the puzzle
Major, major hustle
Gotta prove he was framed, framed for the crime
And when the reel´s properly fishing, we strike like a missile

(Chorus) x2
Prison break anthem, prison break anthem
Just what you need, just what you need
Brother locked up, freedom it's over now
I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm making it happen
Prison break anthem, prison break anthem
Just what you need, just what you need
My brother locked up, freedom it's over now
I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm making it happen

(whisper: prison break anthem, prison break anthem)
