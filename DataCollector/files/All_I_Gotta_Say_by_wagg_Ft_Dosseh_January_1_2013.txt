[Hook/Refrain : Swagg Dinero]
I've done been across the map, and I've done seen a lot of fake
Niggas know it's all one hunna when they look up in my face
Foreign ridin out in France and it's just me and bro Dosseh
Jojo World and Parabellum bitch that's all I gotta say !
I've done been across the map, and I've done seen a lot of fake
Niggas know it's all one hunna when they look up in my face
Foreign ridin out in France and it's just me and bro Dosseh
Jojo World and Parabellum bitch that's all I gotta say !

[Verse/Couplet 1 : Swagg Dinero]
I get the shit all by myself, it's like them nigga went procès
Got a couple commas put up, for 19 my money great
Keep a .30, no revolvers cause we never play it safe
Plus you know I keep it on me just so I can feel okay
Jojo World! Je suis un patron
Band up, band up, turn up, turn up, them Oz, we leave them gone
I've fallen off drink, off dope, I'm in my zone
Hol' up! And if you think that I'm lackin', boy you're wrong
.32 stuffed up in my Ruger, my youngin's thirsty to do yah
And know when I say they'll do yah, they'll shoot yah and steal your jewelery
My clip longer than a ruler, my shooters, they gonna do yah
The squad Parabellum shooter, your nightmare, I'm Freddy Kruger

[Hook/Refrain : Swagg Dinero]
I've done been across the map, and I've done seen a lot of fake

[Couplet/Verse 2 : Dosseh]
Cessez de bander sur des fakes ! Ouvre grand la bouche que j'y défèque
Connection tah les States, igo ! Je n'ai aucun respect
L'ange du Bien à ma droite, l'ange du Mal à ma gauche
Suffit d'un 16 mesures dans la boîte, pour que les ghettos youths se rallient à ma cause
Sort les grosses gams' qu'on enflamme l’asphalte, kilogramme, sexe anal, chatte
C'est tout ce dont le hood jacte, ce qui ne te tue pas te rend cul d'jatte, Ok !
Droguer, escroquer, laisse croquer, mes gars sont bloqués
La bourse ou la vie hombre, pas besoin de développer
Bien trop frais, bien trop chaud, j'fais le plein de lovs' et le plein d'mojo
A peu de choses près j'suis le même négro, sous les spotlights ou à l'ombre des projos
Si c'est pas pour un biff, fuck leur(s) beef(s) et leur(s) pseudo(s) guerre(s)
P.A.R.A.Bellum ! Clique ! Clique ! Jojo Gang !
