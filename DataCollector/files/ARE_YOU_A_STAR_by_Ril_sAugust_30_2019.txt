          
            
            [Chorus x2]
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I’m shocked I can't even find my words
This is it
You're just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream

[Verse 1]
Solitary on a Friday
Starving now I need some peaches
Hmhmhm
Looking in the cards I flip
Nothing really find for me
Hmhmhmhm
Maybe I am not that hungry
Maybe it’s a trap full of lust and envy
I won't fall in it
Rilès you already did
Put the phone down
Open reason
Go for a run
But please do not touch and smoke your drogas, drogas
I'm too weak so I roll a big one, big one
Then I trip and I keep on scrollin down, scroll down
I say "bye my ethic" I'm so dumb, so dumb, hun
She pick up the phone
I pick up my weed
And my lust
And my greed
And the others sins
I don't wanna talk
I just wanna feel
Not aware of tonight's true insanity

[Chorus x2]
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I'm shocked I can’t even find my words
This is it
You’re just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream

[Verse 2]
Knock knock
"Who's there?"
"It’s the Sheitan motherfucker let's play"
She already naked
And she feeling really really thirsty wow
Looking like a model nothing like them hoes
Waking up the savage in me, can't control
Let me put all of my pain down in your pussy
With my pace I wish you will endure like nobody did
Ouh, damn
She a savage
Pull on her horns like she was the villain
And we fucking and banging and banging and fucking and fucking and fucking and banging and fucking like
Wow!
I can't believe what we did
Was it fake or was it real ? (hmhmhmhm)
She feeling like I’m a star
She feeling my energy

[Pre-Chorus]
Sin by sin
One by one
I'm finally back home
But I want a second round
For my first time in heaven
Sin by sin
One by one
It's minutes before dawn
So I call her back again

[Chorus]
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I'm shocked I can't even find my words
This is it
You're just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream

[Verse 3]
Jump back in the car like a fool
Guided by my thirst and my flute
The scene is the same at the door
She even wilder than before
She rippin' my polo
Grind on my torso
She ain't looking like she be clean tho
I saw the evil on her face
Yet I
Did her like I never did
(Hey!)
On the sofa, the floor and the kingsize bed
Up and down and from behind she did that split
Better than movies, realer than fantasies
But, I looked into them eyes it was all blank and bleak
"Hey what happened? We're not finished
Why you rushing in the kitchen?"
Then she comes back
I say "whats'up"
She said
"You're never gonna leave"

Goddamn

She got a knife and she smiles at me
Ayahuasca she told me she drank
I think she lost her mind
I think I noticed it
I slept with the Evil, it just looks like

[Chorus x2]
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I'm shocked I can't even find my words
This is it
You're just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream
