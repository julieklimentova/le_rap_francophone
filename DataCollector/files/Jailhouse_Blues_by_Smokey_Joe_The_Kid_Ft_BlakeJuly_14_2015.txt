          
            
            [Verse 1]
I'm sick of this pity within me
I'm ready to get up and hit it with all I got
Outta the parking lot
Even if I'm a not
Get it right when I want
Running a marathon struggling carrying
Buckets of tears that replenish the fear (Run)
I wanna be there with the fire and venom
Combine with elements
Shine with the rest of them
Rise like a pheonix
Deny all the demons
That trying to keep me from livin' my vision (hit back)
Stripping it all off
All these chains that I made it's all on me cause I maybe
Cut away my way of knowing that power that burning in all us
I can feel it now
Swelling in my stomach hear it (Shout out)
Screaming in anger raging bulldog
Don't give a damn get get gone (Get out)
It's like that something inside me running to catch that
Objective, I panic intimidated I figure (Why you in it?)
I'm just another figure striving to make an effort
Schizophrenic nature shaking my stature and I... (You gotta let it)

[Chorus]
Sometimes
I feel lost and locked up in the jail cell in my mind
And I try to understand the situation
See eye to eye
But sometimes
I feel lost and locked up in the jail cell in my mind
And I try
To understand the situation
See eye to eye

[Verse 2]
I see my freedom in visions
Get up to speed to living I supersede the defeat
Like a teacher speaking wisdom
Get down to business and handle this shit we trample
Everyone just trying to manage within comes that evil twin to preaching...
We in a billion of little shimmering chameleons
Who cover up our existence
Seems like no one gonna make a difference
(come back)
Just look at the picture different
(Recap)
Forget the limits keep crushing them boulders
(Take that)
Some moments come up to make look in the mirror
Knock sense in my fear of drowning surrounded by evil stares
(It goes)
I say goodbye to all that poison inside
Within the evil eye I see an endless pit of demise
I'm sick of the judging it's nothing but hate in disguise
So much assuming the worst while its truth is denied
The power resides to the one questioning why
And the one who confides and admits to the crime

[Chorus]
Sometimes
I feel lost and locked up in the jail cell in my mind
And I try to understand the situation
See eye to eye
But sometimes
I feel lost and locked up in the jail cell in my mind
And I try
To understand the situation
See eye to eye

Sometimes
I feel lost and locked up in the jail cell in my mind
And I try to understand the situation
See eye to eye...
