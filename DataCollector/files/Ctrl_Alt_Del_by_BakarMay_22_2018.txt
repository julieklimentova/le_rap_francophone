It's that time, it's that time
It's white lies and white lines
White lies and white lines

[Verse]
Control alt delete, control alt delete
Remember that time you fell down in the street
And I picked you back up and we ain't looked back since
You're my princess I'm your prince
I go yoga you go gym
I'm your plane and you're my wings
And we can fly so far, long time so we ain't speak
We ain't bredrins we go deep
Long time since I swept you off your feet, girl what
I ain't got the answers and if I did girl I would share the answers
And if you come back I won't let my chance slip
Plus I'm on my new shit
Yeah, paranoid running through the night
I wanna fuck, don't wanna fight
I take it back when you cry
I take it back when we fight, I

[Hook]
This time, it's this time
It's that time, it's that time
It's white lies and white lines
White lies and white lines

[Outro]
I want you, I want you
I need you, I need you
I want you, I want you
I need you, I need you
