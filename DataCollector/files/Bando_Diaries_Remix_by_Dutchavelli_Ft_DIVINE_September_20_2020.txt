(Big Zeeko)

[Chorus: Dutchavelli]
I can tell you 'bout bando diaries
I never done 419 or fraud
Nokia phone and a Lyca sim
In the whip with cash and I’m goin' up North
I straight drop crack in boiling water
Who woulda thought rap would open doors? (Doors)
Retaliation is a must
When I buck my opps, there's no remorse (There’s no remorse)

[Verse 1: J Emz (ONEFOUR)]
No maybe, If's or buts (done with the talking)
27 ride out to the 5th
When I come through
Waving that stick like Dutch
Try ask me and the war is simple
We hate them and the boys hate us
Plus I'm in love with all of that grieving
Anytime one of them gets touched (Grab it, Cut it, Brеak it ?)
Parcel came like a rugby ball
Put that in a tee and boot it (Boot it)
I ain't with all thе schemes and rumours (Nah)
I provide for the fiends and shooters (That's Gang)
Cops got us on surveillance cuz, and it ain't for the music (True)
If you're down for the gang then prove it
Go show my men how to use it (Where they at)

[Chorus: Dutchavelli]
I can tell you 'bout bando diaries
I never done 419 or fraud
Nokia phone and a Lyca sim
In the whip with cash and I’m goin’ up North
I straight drop crack in boiling water
Who woulda thought rap would open doors? (Doors)
Retaliation is a must
When I buck my opps, there's no remorse (There’s no remorse)

[Verse 2: Kekra]
Retaliation is a must
When I buck my opps, there's no remorse (wow)
Trop chaud j'suis pas comme les autres
Y'a d’la mousse moche qui sort d'la bouche des autres
Crackpipe, overdose
J'te baise, j'passe à autre chose
Armes de l'Est remplacent la Bose
Pour éteindre la mèche, gros j'expose

[Bridge: Kekra]
Take the time, take the time
Quand il s'agit de représailles
J'arrache la médaille, j'fais pas d'détails
Un re-fré die, ça sort le nine
Pour garder l'smile ça take ta maille
Peine capitale, j'décapite, aïe
Peine capitale, j'décapite, huh

[Chorus: Dutchavelli]
I can tell you 'bout bando diaries
I never done 419 or fraud
Nokia phone and a Lyca sim
In the whip with cash and I'm goin' up North
I straight drop crack in boiling water
Who woulda thought rap would open doors? (Doors)
Retaliation is a must
When I buck my opps, there's no remorse (There's no remorse)

[Verse 3: Spenny (ONEFOUR)]
They can't ? with me about war cah I been on more trips than Postman Pat
Its all fun and games on the internet till they see this spotlight flash
How's this war been tit for tat when we ride on them and they ain't come back
If I ain't cheffing these dogs on the main
Then I'm serving up food in the council flats
Gotta keep my talk to a minimum
'Cause I can't risk my criminal benefits
That's why I dont war like Taliban
There like pussies Ellen DeGeneres
Touch my ? imma settle it
Come beef with a veteran
When you grip that dont get hesitant
Keep back control you adrenaline

[Verse 4: J Emz, Spenny (ONEFOUR)]
8 in the clip
1 in the chamber
Somebody's in danger
Pull up and empty that shit on a stranger
Then its back in the range
Burn that shit then now I'm back on a stage
Who woulda thought I be rapping today?
Bro came home threw some racks his way
Told him chill just relax and pray

[Verse 5: Noizy]
Pussy, what dem a talk
Tell em' watch how badman a walk
Tell em man is back for the war
Man I talk everything now we back for some more
Rvchet niset nga Londra, kta e dinë që ska lojna
Çunat punë paketojna, loja hala është e jona
Like nah, nah, we don't play too much
When war time, we don't pray too much
Nah, nah, we don't play to much
When war time, we don't (bubububum)
E dinë kta jena plot, pasha zotin sboj kot
Çunat n'rrugë si robokop, mbledhi pare si me krap

[Chorus: Dutchavelli]
I can tell you 'bout bando diaries
I never done 419 or fraud
Nokia phone and a Lyca sim
In the whip with cash and I'm goin' up North
I straight drop crack in boiling water
Who woulda thought rap would open doors? (Doors)
Retaliation is a must
When I buck my opps, there's no remorse (There's no remorse)

[Verse 6: Divine]
A hudkavali, hud safari
A Hindustani, Pakistani kudte me ladki mere ped nasari
A jera bhari mena bhetda khali
Smoke mala bag me wala
Jo mein sus kiya sirf kiya [?] batala
Flow batara, shor sharaba sho mera shos hamara
Khali peeli timepass ke mari peeli
Sudwala logon se [?] weli
A Gandhi, Benji Euro pounds [?]
Fuck the genie, fuck the genie
Spice mujhe do, dice mujhe do
Dutchavelli Mumbai ka
Pyar me rak do mujhe de paisa, cha

[Verse 7: Dutchavelli]
The things that I've done with Jeezy, I pray that it never gets seen in court
No face, no case (No face, no case)
I do it bare face, gotta see me abroad (Yeah)
My shorty wants Christian Dior
I made her whip majj with a kitchen fork (Brrt)
Fireman, he on demon time
Need a extendo, no extension cord (Yeah)
As a kid, no, I never liked goin' to school
Fell in love with money and guns
The war with the other side can't get squashed
Till all of them drop, the beef ain't done
Opp in a spliff or 41
Either way, something's gonna have to get bun
Ever since "Dem man", all I hear is "Dem man"
I know dem man'll wanna hear my song (Velli)

[Chorus: Dutchavelli]
I can tell you 'bout bando diaries
I never done 419 or fraud
Nokia phone and a Lyca sim
In the whip with cash and I'm goin' up North
I straight drop crack in boiling water
Who woulda thought rap would open doors? (Doors)
Retaliation is a must
When I buck my opps, there's no remorse (There's no remorse)
