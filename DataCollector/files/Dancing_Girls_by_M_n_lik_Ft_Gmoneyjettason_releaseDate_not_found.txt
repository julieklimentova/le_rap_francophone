Gmoney been up on that rari flow
You know how it go life of a mack

[Hook: Gmoneyjettason]
Hippy girls, ratchets and the models too
This here, is something you can clap it to
Couple dollars, you know I'm finna throw a few
One night, then you know he gone be done with you

[Verse 1: Menelik]
Wavy body attitude so cold
She dispose any clothes over few weeks old
Keep a grinder and a eighth got her ready to roll
But how she keep her bottoms red got her losing her soul
Every weekend its her friends who call
Like bitch get up we fina go hit the mall
Get something tight for the night but don't reveal it all
Then we gone shake our ass to get a man that ball
Like chris, trey usher or alsina or sumn
Maybe a royal fam cat cause i heard they be stuntin
See she used to want the dealer cause she know he be thuggin
But got the boot when he pressed her and she thought he was bluffin
Told her if you wanna stay here at my crib
Then E14 where you grindin for the kid
Now its one nights for lime light searching for the one pipe
In hopes she can be a kardashian over night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Menelik]
He said if i made them dollars then why the hell i can't throw em
She gone pop that ass cause my chain been glowin
Want block boys wit cash so my 8 ball showin
And a mink on my back cause my ice keep snowing
I know, i know she just tryna live
Like the dons doin better than beverly in the hills
Wit the goons from the hood where yo best friend was killed
Or the migo brought the brick and the bubble became real
See i mentioned jimmy choo and her face then lit up
Like a fat boy eatin the birthday cake up
Plus for that christian louboutin
She would kneel for my pleasure longer than marathons
But i ain't nobody played out sugar daddy
You make that money then you bring it back to me
Occupation where the weather don't control the rain
Make it flood and them youngins probably running a train

[Hook]
