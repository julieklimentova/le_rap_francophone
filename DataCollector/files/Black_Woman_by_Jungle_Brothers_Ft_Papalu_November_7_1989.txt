          
            
            Black Woman, mother of my earth
Black Woman, you gave me birth
You can truly see what's in me
You can help me be the best that I can be
You feed my fire when I'm on the wire
Keepin' me calm when it's gettin' higher
Sweet like sugar and hot like wine
Always keepin' ya on my mind
You're givin' my life a new light to reach for
Giving me so much how could I ask for more
Keepin' us tight when we're gettin' loose
The darker the berry the sweeter the juice
Black Woman
Recess
You started out just a little girl
Given the power to change the world
And though some of your ways to man are odd
You are the proof that there is a God
Black Woman ya are the mother of all
Black Woman ya stand so firm and tall
And as you aged mind body and soul
You became more beautiful
You are the Future you are the Wisdom
The Wisdom that the evil Forces tried to hide
But no longer will you be hidden
In my Jungle you will always exist
Your wish is my command
Yo command is my wish
And the job of the Man is to respect
Protect be fruitful and multiply
Honor and love love and honor
Until the Day She Dies
Black Woman
Recess
Love the woman's weapon
With every great man there's a woman behind him
Her womb is the chamber that produces life
Her breast provides the nutrition for growth
A guardian angel in the flesh
Representin' the man that watches over us both
Sent from the Heavens and the sky above
Black Woman it's you that I love
You are the Moon that I reach for
There's no doubt in my mind that it's you I adore
Sent from the Heavens and the skies above
Black Woman it's you that I love
