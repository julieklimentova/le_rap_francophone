          
            
            [Verse]
I found a way I could catch that feel good
Skies been turnin', fires been burnin' since '93
Wait just a moment, I can drop my values
Skies been turnin', fires been burnin' since 17

[Pre-Chorus]
Traveling so far to get there
All just to be here again
All just to see what they saw back then

[Chorus]
I think it's time that you call back home, son
Fire's still scorchin', you've been scorned
And you look abused
Did you get out all of that angry passion?
Is it still formin'? Has it started to torture you?
Traveling so far to get there
All just to be here again
All just to see what they saw back then

[Bridge]
Well, you could put it all on me
Well, you could put it all on me
Well, you could put it all on me

[Outro]
I found a way I could catch that feel good
Skies been turnin', fires been burnin' since '93
