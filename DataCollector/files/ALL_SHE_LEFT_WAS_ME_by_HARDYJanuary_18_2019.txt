          
            
            [Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, hungover all alone
Went to fix a cup of coffee, but the coffee pot was gone
Thought the world was ending, and I got left behind
But all that really happened was she meant it this time
Now she's southbound, loaded down up to the top
I'm just sitting here in this empty box

[Chorus]
She took my ride, took my pride, all the whiskey I drank
She took my 3030, took them dirty dishes from the sink
Guess I'll stare at the square where our pictures used to be
'Cause all she left was me

[Verse 2]
Well, I'd put on some records, hell, try and get her gone
But I ain't got a needle or a groove to drop it on
Guess the silver line is ain't gotta lock my door
You can't steal what ain't hear anymore

[Chorus]
Took my cigars, my guitar, even took my dog
She took the mail, took the white-tailed buck off my wall
So I'm sitting here now where the couch used to be
'Cause all she left was me
Yeah, that's right, all she left (Woo!)

[Bridge]
I'd clean up my act, but she took the broom
She better hope her next man's got a whole lot of room

[Chorus]
She took my ride, took my pride, took my new flatscreen
She took the girl of my dreams out the songs that I sing
I guess I'll stare at the square where our pictures used to be
'Cause all she left was me, yeah
Man, if I could find my wallet, I'd go drown in a drink
But all she left was me, yeah, that's right

[Outro]
All she left, all she left
All she left was me (Woo!)
All she left, all she left
All she left was me, yeah
