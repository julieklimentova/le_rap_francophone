          
            
            Shout out all the ones who stuck with me
This the year we always planned for
Say that you don’t really fuck with me
Then tell me what keeping tabs for
My biggest critics are the biggest mimics
Tryna copy me just for a bag or
My biggest critics are just bitching bout shit
Like I should sing less & should rap more
Careful what you ask for
If I really wanna gas it, I could put 100 on the dashboard (facts)
100,000 streams on a track from when I was 16 if you really want a facts war (facts)
If you really want steam
Know that Nate got the beam
We’ll be kicking down your door like the task force
Whole team out here fucking up the scene and won’t cease
Till we running out of
Pages in out passport
It’s part of our plans yeah
Boys from the Eastside building a platform
The others rappers won’t last
Their music is gassed
I kind feel bad for em
I’ve just been stashing these stacks &
Breaking it up for the people I’d pass for
Tell the promoter that I’ma need cash advance
Fuck did you think that I rap for
Don’t make me laugh more
I’m bout my bank
And ain’t talking bout backboard
I’m bout to fuck up the game
If you get in my way then you better be ready to back yours
They let us in through the backdoor
You ain’t even on the list
We talking shots in the VIP
You took a shot and you missed
You ain’t even coming close
Me I’m really with the shits
Keep my name out your mouth boy
You don’t know what I’m about boy
Next time you try to come for me
I’ll make it personal you fucking clout boy
Got me talking crazy
Back on my bullshit
Your shit didn’t phase me
I don’t give a fuck
Fuck you pay me
Fuck TooZany
You cannot tame me
I know lately I've been low-key, undercover
But new shits way overdue
Still the youngest undiscovered motherfucker
No ones touching, you know it's true
Please name another one doing numbers
Truly independent, in my state
I'm talking without agents or promoters
Or without a budget...I'll wait…
You let your team take control of you (yeah)
You only do what you're told to do
You is a lame, please stay in your lane
And do what you’re supposed to do
Before I fuck around & start exposing you
You're 0 & 3, I hold the lead
It's bout time I finally pull it thru
I'm ODB, these bitches owing me
But there ain't shit that I owe to you
Fuck tit for tat bitch
I'll go toe-to-toe with you
Just to show to you
I’m not the one you wanna let get ahold of you
Fuck with me
There’s no hope for you
