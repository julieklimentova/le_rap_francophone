No matter what you say
Children won't listen
No matter what you know
Children refuse to learn

Guide them along the way
Still, they don't listen
Children can only grow
From something you love
To something you loose

She'll be back
Next to me, who is he?
She'll be back
She'll be back

She's a fool
She just thinks she'll be free
We shall see
Free is one thing she never will be

Every place that she goes
Every face, every rose
Everything that she does
She'll remember what was
And she'll want to come home

She'll be back
You'll be back!

If there's one thing I know
You'll be back
She'll be back

She'll be back
She's just eager to grow
She's just young

By tomorrow or so
Or as long as it takes
Let her go
Let her make her mistakes

I don't care what she thinks about me
Just as long as she thinks about me
When she thinks of the good times we had
Not the bad
She'll be back

I can wait
She'll be back

Just a matter of when
Til' the day we're the way we were then

Once she knows who she is
What she's done
What it's cost
What she's lost

Once she sees having him she has nothing
Once her dreams turn to dust
Once she knows who to trust
She'll be back

She'll be back
I'll be here
She'll be back
She'll...
