          
            
            Nobody understands me
Although I wish they would
Nobody understands me
I hate being misunderstood

Nobody understands me
No matter how I try
Nobody understands me
I can't understand why

When I think of all the glorble snop
I've tried so hard to explain!
They all look amused
Or a little confused
What can't they see what I mean?
(It's very snooffly)

Nobody understands me
Though memmily blitt each day
Nobody understands me
But I guess zooglobble that way

How can I make you understand?
How can I make you see?
Why does my queckery biffle you so?
Where will this ezzleboo dornut go?
What do explectionary inyews know?

When will you yuddle for me?
Nobody beezifies me
Nobody febbin ud
Kibblezy deen voo nizee!
I hate being misunderstood
