          
            
            [Verse 1]
It's grim all day, we're down in the dungeons
Livin' in a town of hard times called London
Looking for a job cause your job's redundant
Fuck it all off and go to the function
Do what we want from Monday to Sunday
Stop me and search, I don't give her no face
No officer, I don't do no cocaine
No officer, I don't give you no name

[Chorus]
It's all in your head, so just get out of bed
And do something instead of just wastin' your time
I know that you're tryna be my own worst enemy
Standin' in front of me, wastin' my time

[Verse 2]
Wish that it was easy just tryna be me
Freedom is a freebie, would you believe it?
Seein' is believin', don't stop me dreamin'
I say, "Fuck the queen," tell me if it's treason
Wish that it was easy just tryna be me
Freedom is a freebie, would you believe it?
Seein' is believin', don't stop me dreamin'
I say, "Fuck the queen," tell me if it's treason

[Chorus]
It's all in your head, so just get out of bed
And do something instead of just wastin' your time
I know that you're tryna be my own worst enemy
Standin' in front of me, wastin' my time
Wastin' my time, wastin' my time
Wastin' my time, wastin' my time
Time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time

[Outro]
Fuck off!
