No game
All alone, do my thang
Broke boys, rich girls
Get the bread your own way

Ooh~

Suit yourself
I feel that
Don't you dare look back
You'll be fine, I promise
Don't you dare lose focus

All the stuff, I feel that
Don't you dare look back
You'll be fine, I promise
Don't you dare lose focus

Big brain
No game
All alone, do my thang
Broke boys, rich girls
Get the bread your own way

Big brain

All alone, do my thang
Broke boys, rich girls
Get the bread your own way
