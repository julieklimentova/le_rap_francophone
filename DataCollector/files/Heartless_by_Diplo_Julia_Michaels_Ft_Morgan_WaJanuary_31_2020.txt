Heartless, heartless, heartless
So heartless, so heartless, so heartless

[Verse 1: Julia Michaels]
Say you're goin' out late
I count down 'til you call me
It's just one of those things
That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you
Win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself

[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Morgan Wallen, Morgan Wallen]
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)

[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen with Julia Michaels]
Monday night was definitely not our night
Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday, I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night, we went out on the town
Saturday, we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone
I should probably know this shit by now
Ah, oh (Ah, oh)
I should probably know this shit by now
But no (But no), no

[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Morgan Wallen]
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?
Why you gotta be so heartless?

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Julia Michaels]
Girl, why you gotta be so in between
Loving me and leaving, leaving?
Ah, oh (Ah, oh, yeah)
I should probably know this shit by now
But no (But no), no

[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Morgan Wallen, Julia Michaels]
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches (Yeah, yeah)
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (Ooh, oh)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (Yeah)
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? (Why you gotta be so heartless?)
Oh, oh
