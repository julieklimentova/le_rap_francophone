          
            
            Yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
And if we fuckin', girl, don't tell your friends, keep it a secret (Baby girl, keep it a secret)
You only know you get to fuck me when it is convenient (You only get to fuck me, ayy)
If I say I love you, I'll be honest, I don't mean it (If I say I love you, I'll be honest, I don't mean it)
But we know we been hurt before and we got our reasons

[Verse]
Lately I been getting a feeling you plan on leaving
Every time you not by my side, I swear I have trouble breathing
I be having trouble breathing
I be having trouble breathing
I be having trouble breathing, 'ing
Everywhere I go, they say, "Bam, you my favorite"
Ballin' so much, need a motherfuckin' agent
We don't talk to police, we don't do no statement
She just wanna see me, I can make arrangements
You need reservations, just a confirmation
All this old jade on a nigga lookin' Asian
Really some money, worst on the pavement
When I put my mind, I go on a vacation
You know I sip that codeine, shawty sip that bubbly
You can come and fuck with me, but I do no cuddling
I heard you got your heart broke and you're still recovering
I see it in your eyes, though, baby, you're still suffering
If you fall in love with him, my phone'll keep you company
Or we can get freaky and I'll make your pussy cum for me
Swear that I'm just reminiscing all the things you done to me
I knew you never loved me and you just was havin' fun with me

[Chorus]
And if we fuckin', girl, don't tell your friends, keep it a secret (Baby girl, keep it a secret)
You only know you get to fuck me when it is convenient (You only get to fuck me, ayy)
If I say I love you, I'll be honest, I don't mean it (If I say I love you, I'll be honest, I don't mean it)
But we know we been hurt before and we got our reasons (Yeah, you know, baby, every fuckin' reason)

[Outro]
We got every fuckin' reason
Yeah, you know we all got reasons
Uh
