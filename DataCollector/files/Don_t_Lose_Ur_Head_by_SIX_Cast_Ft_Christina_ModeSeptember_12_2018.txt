Grew up in the French court
Oui oui bonjour
Life was a chore
So

[ENSEMBLE]
She set sail

[ANNE BOLEYN]
1522 came straight to the UK
All the British dudes lame

[ENSEMBLE]
Epic fail!
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
I wanna dance and sing

[ENSEMBLE]
Politics

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Not my thing

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
But then I met the king
And soon my daddy said
"You should try and get ahead!"
He wanted me, obviously
Kept messaging me like every day
Couldn't be better then he sent me a letter
And who am I kidding
I was prêt à manger

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Sent a reply

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Just saying ’Hi'

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
'You’re a nice guy
I'll think about it maybe
XO baby'

[ENSEMBLE]
Uh oh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Here we go

[ENSEMBLE]
You sent him kisses?!

[ANNE BOLEYN]
I didn't know I would move in with his missus

[ENSEMBLE]
What?!

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Get a life!

[ENSEMBLE]
You were living with his wife?

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Like, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don’t lose your head
I didn’t mean to hurt anyone
LOL
Say 'Oh, well!’
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head

Three in the bed
And the little one said
"If you wanna be wed
Make up your mind!"
Her or me, chum
Don’t wanna be some
Girl in a threesome
Are you blind?

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Don't be bitter

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
'Cause I'm fitter

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Why hasn't it hit her?
He doesn't wanna bang you
Somebody hang you

[ENSEMBLE]
Uh oh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Here we go

[ENSEMBLE]
Your comment went viral

[ANNE BOLEYN]
I didn't really mean it
But rumours spiral

[ENSEMBLE]
Wow Anne, way to make the country hate you!

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Mate, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL
Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head

Tried to elope
But the Pope said 'Nope!'
Our only hope was Henry
He got a promotion
Caused a commotion
Set in motion the C of E

[ENSEMBLE]
The rules

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Were so outdated
Us two wanted to get X-rated

[ENSEMBLE]
Soon
Excommunicated

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Everybody chill
It's totes God's will

[WEDDING CHIMES]

Henry's out every night on the town
Just sleeping around like "What the hell?"
If that's how it's gonna be
Maybe I'll flirt with a guy or three
Just to make him jel
Henry finds out and he goes mental
He screams and shouts like
So judgemental!
You damned witch
Mate, just shut up!
I wouldn't be such a b...
If you could get it up

[ENSEMBLE]
Uh oh

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Here we go

[ENSEMBLE]
Is that what you said?

[ANNE BOLEYN]
And now he's going 'round like
"Off with her head!"

[ENSEMBLE]
No!

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he means it

[ENSEMBLE]
Seems it

[ANNE BOLEYN]
What was I meant to do?

[ENSEMBLE]
What was she meant to do?

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Like, what was I meant to do?

[ENSEMBLE]
What was she meant to do?

[ANNE BOLEYN]
No, but what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL
Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!

[ENSEMBLE]
Just go to hell!

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Sorry, not sorry about what I said

[ENSEMBLE]
Sorry, not sorry about what she said

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
Don't lose your head
