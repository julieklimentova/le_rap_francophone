He got down on one knee, but I said "No way"
Packed my bags and moved into a n-n-nunnery
Joined the gospel choir
Our riffs were on fire
At the top of the charts is where I'm gonna stay

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Henry sent me a poem all about my green sleeves
I changed a couple words, put it on a sick beat
The song blew their minds
Next minute I was signed
And now I'm writing lyrics for Shakesy P

[JANE SEYMOUR]
Since my first son, our family's grown
We made a band and got quite well known
You could perhaps
Call us the Tudor Von Trapps
I'm just kidding
We're called the Royal-ing Stones!

[ALL]
We're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six

[ANNA OF CLEVES]
What a shame, yeah, my face, it cost me the crown
So I moved to theâ€”

[ALL, spoken]
Haus of Holbein!

[ANNA OF CLEVES]
In my hometown
His mates were super arty
But I showed them how to party
Now on my tour of Prussia, everybody gets down

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
Music man tried it on and I was like, "Bye"
So I thought, "Who needs him?" I can give it a try
I learned everything
Now all I do is sing
And I'll do that until I die

[CATHERINE PARR]
Heard all about these rockin' chicks
Loved every song and each remix
So I went out and found them
And we laid down an album
Now, I don't need your love
All I need is Six

[ALL]
We're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six, whoa, whoa
We're Six, whoa-oh-oh
We're Six, whoa, whoa
For five more minutes

It's the end of the show, of the historemix
We switched up the flow and we changed the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But we want to say before we drop the curtain
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
All that we know is that we used to be six wives

But now we're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six, whoa, whoa
We're Six, whoa-oh-oh
We're Six, whoa, whoa
For five, four, three, two, one more minute
We're Six
