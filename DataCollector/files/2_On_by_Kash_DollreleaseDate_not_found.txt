Wake up in the morning, give me head, nigga
Treat me like a queen, breakfast in the bed, nigga
Yeah, if you scared, call the rev, nigga
Thick bitch, so you better come prepared, nigga
Yeah, OT shit
I be in L.A popping bottles on the beach, shit
I'm so fucking G, we should call this shit the G mix
Kash Doll, Tinashe, baby, it's the remix!

[Chorus: Tinashe]
Let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let's, let's, let's, roll
I love to get 2 on
I love to let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let's, let's, let's, roll
I love to get 2 on
I love 2, let's, let's roll

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
Kash Doll, with the ass out
Throw it back, make a grown nigga tap out (Uh)
Fuck a baller, belly nigga, pull some racks out (Right)
If you ain't got no cash, nigga sit your ass down
Dang, all in a bitch face
Talking bout you bout to ball like, oh bitch, k
I'm with some bad bitches
Type you never had bitches
I might let you hit it, but you couldn't pay the tab, nigga (Nigga)

[Verse 3: Tinashe]
If you a lame, nigga, you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young, that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice
We can mob all in the whip
Make the money, make a grip
I be stuntin' with my clique
Getting faded 'till we trip (Oh)

[Outro: Tinashe]
Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
