          
            
            (Uh huh)
But you never leave
Oh whoa oh oh
Never (uh huh)
But you never ever leave
Oh whoa oh oh
But you never
No...
Well you're wrapped up in a blanket and you're staring at the floor
The conversation's moderated by the noisy streets below
I never wanna hurt you baby, I'm just a mess with a name and a price
And now I'm drunker than before they told me drinking doesn't make me nice
You never know where some people will go
Yeah some people been hurtin' me
You can tell by look, by the slightest crook
In the neck or the blink of an eye
Well then we'll see what they say and we'll do what they do
But that doesn't mean a goddamn thing
You can listen if you want, you can listen if you don't
Yeah they'll talk, yeah they'll even sing
(Everybody now! Oh oh oh oh oh)
They come singing through the window, singing through the trees
Yeah they're singing through the bright spring leaves
(Everybody now! Oh oh oh oh oh)
Yeah they love you when they need you
But someday you're gonna need to
Find some other kind of place to go, oh
(Uh huh)
But you never leave
Oh whoa oh oh
Never (uh huh)
But you never ever leave
Oh whoa oh oh
But you never
No...
Now you're standing in the kitchen, and you're pouring out my drink
Well there's a very obvious difference, and it's that one of us can think
If there's a bump in the road yeah you'd fix it
But for me I'll just run off the road
But tonight you've got me cornered, and I haven't got a place to go
You never know where some people will go
Yeah some people been hurtin' me
You can tell by look, by the slightest crook
In the neck or the blink of an eye
Well then we'll see what they say and we'll do what they do
But that doesn't mean a goddamn thing
You can listen if you want, you can listen if you don't
Yeah they'll talk, yeah they'll even sing
(Everybody now! Oh oh oh oh oh)
They come singing through the window, singing through the trees
Yeah they're singing through the bright spring leaves
Everybody now, oh oh oh oh oh (Sing it loud, sing it loud)
Yeah they love you when they need you
But someday you're gonna need to
Find some other kind of place to go, oh
Don't you know?
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
