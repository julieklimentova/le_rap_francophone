          
            
            [Verse 1]
I'm in your area code
I hit you up, are you alone?
So many places this could go
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm fucked up, you don't even know
Baby, it's better that you don't
I'm guessing now my cover's blown
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Don't know why I do it, but I do
Yeah, every time I have a drink or two
Get it bad  for you (Bad for you)
And I don't know why I do it but I do, yeah
All this liquor bringing out the truth

[Verse 2]
And I, we both remember what we said
But let's agree to just forget
It's late night, you should go to bed
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You say I never been good for you
You can't deny I gave it good to you
We made it unforgettable, it's crazy
And I'm hoping I could let you in
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Don't know why I do it, but I do, yeah
Every time I have a drink or two
Get it bad  for you (Bad for you)
And I don't know why I do it but I do, yeah
All this liquor bringing out the truth
And I don't know why I do it, but I do
Don't know why I do it, but I, but, I
Yeah
