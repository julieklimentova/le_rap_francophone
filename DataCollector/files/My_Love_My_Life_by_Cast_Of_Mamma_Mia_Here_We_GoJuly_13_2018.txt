          
            
            [Verse 1: Lily James]
I’ve never felt this strong
I’m invincible, how could this go wrong?
No, here, here’s where we belong
I see a road ahead
I never thought I would dare to tread

[Chorus: Meryl Streep]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
All I love so dearly
Images passing by
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words I try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don’t possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You will be my love and my life
You’re my one and only

[Verse 2: Meryl Streep]
I held you close to me
Felt your heart beat
And I thought: I am free
Oh yes, and as one are we
In the now and beyond
Nothing and no one can break this bond

[Chorus: Meryl Streep & Amanda Seyfried]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
All I love so dearly
Images passing by
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words I try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don’t possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You are still my love and my life

[Outro: Meryl Streep & Amanda Seyfried]
Yes, I know I don’t possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
You’re my one and only
