Everybody wants to bite a piece of the cake
No, you won't go 'fore you got your name
Carevd in minds of who you really praise
Everybody wants to take your seat, forsake
You shall not go after you made it, man
Not enough to get the man a name

[Verse 1]
From the bottom of the jungle
To the perfume of a blunt
Gotta quit the Remington
Frome the beauty of the sun
To the booty of my girl
I won't leave you 'till I'm done
I know I gave it lot of praises
But damnation feels like it's fading away
I know I gave y'all lotta hard times
Though t my mission would end after 52 songs
Shut down the suicide doors
This is my life, homie
You decide yours
Y'all know that Ye was my force
This ain't my time
I still gotta eat more
Y'all know that he talked to me
"Find a way to tell 'em
Then you'ill go back to me"
Wut ?
This is how it was supposed to be
I don't want that shit anymore
Sorry Lord I'm more than just a puzzle

[Bridge]
I know I'm running the risk
Won't ever know what's rest
Oh no no
I know I'm running the risk
Don't you want me to dare ?

[Chorus]
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet

[Verse 2]
Crooked minds
Shady Ideas
Relentless will
Are perfect pieces
For the bam bam
Times saved me many times
I always knew that patience
Would've been one of my best friend
You bungee jump
Me, marathon in this game
Better keep my pace on track
I run run
This empire's too young
If you leave it
I swear the foundations
Gon swifftly fall down

[Bridge]
I know I'm running the risk
Won't ever know what's rest
Oh no no
I know I'm running the risk
Don't you want me to dare ?

[Chorus]
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet

[Verse 3]
Let's
Beat the frame arround the fakers
Not in your TV
But will appear in your cabesas
Let's
Be the ones you'll always always notice
Leave a chance on the ground
And Imma be there to take it
Let's
Gain back the 20 lbs I lost
And gave my face it's true color
I'm sick of that dull
Let's
Stay here 'till forever
Until he takes me
Back to heaven

[Chorus]
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
