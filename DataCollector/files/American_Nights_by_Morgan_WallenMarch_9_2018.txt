          
            
            [Verse 1]
Blue ribbon bottles
Big black throttles
Marlborough's if you want 'em
Go on and take a drag
Little small town freedom
Little taste of dreaming
No need to preach, no need to shout, we believe in

[Chorus]
American nights
Wanted line
Cutting down Main Street in the dark
Muscle shows, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars

[Verse 2]
Faded Levi's
Worn out Chuck's
20 in my pocket
Feels like a million bucks
Blue eyed beauty, lean into me
Our own show in the back row
Miss the whole damn movie

[Chorus]
American nights
Wanted line
Cutting down Main Street in the dark
Muscle shows, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars
American nights

[Bridge]
Pray the morning don't come
These colours don't run
Stay up and stay young

[Chorus]
American nights, American nights
Wanted line
Cutting down Main Street in the dark
Muscle shows, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars
American nights, American nights
American nights, American nights

[Outro]
Pray the morning don't come
Stay up and stay young
