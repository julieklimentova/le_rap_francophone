Climate change is having a real impact
On the lives of individuals
And communities around the world
We must do something about it
In December in Copenhagen
Our leaders will have an opportunity
To come up with a robust post-climate agreement
That is viable and will help make this planet a better place

[Verse 1- Serena Ryder]
Down at the river bed
The earth is cracked and dry instead
Farms are failing, cities baking
Steam in 45 degrees

[Hook- Amadou & Mariam, Vincent Perez, Will Lee, The All-American Rejects, & Marion Cotillard]
The time has come
To take a stand
It's for the Earth
It's for our land
The time has come
A fact's a fact
The heat is on
No turning back

[Post-Hook- Serena Ryder]
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

How can we dance when our earth is turning (How can we dance, how can we dance)

[Hook- Guillaume Canet & Youssou N'Dour]
The time has come
To take a stand

From Bejing west to Timbuktu

The global village lives and breathes
In 45 degrees

[Hook- Ed Robertson, Mélanie Laurent, Jamie Burke, & Hawksley Workman]
The time has come
To take a stand
It's for the Earth
It's for our land
The time has come
A fact's a fact
The heat is on
No turning back

[Duran Duran Milla Jovovich, & Mélanie Laurent]
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

[Hook- Dan Black]
The time has come
To take a stand
It's for the Earth
It's for our land
The time has come
A fact's a fact
The heat is on
No turning back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
