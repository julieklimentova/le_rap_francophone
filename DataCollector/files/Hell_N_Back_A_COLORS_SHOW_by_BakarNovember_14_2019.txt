          
            
            [Chorus]
Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was on me

[Verse 1]
I mixed a lot of love with a lot of drugs, then I found you
She liked petty crimes, she had green eyes like Mountain Dew
And where she go, I'll never know, her friends bounced too
I guess it's their loss 'cause they'll never know what we'll amount to
And would you be my light, be my yellow?
P.Y.T. walking down Portobello
Got a smile on his face at the end of the day
MDMA helped us fly away
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would save my life?
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would fly my kite?
Could you tell, could you tell?

[Chorus]
Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was on me

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

[Verse 2]
I remember, I remember, we was all alone
Late night, you would call my phone
Just to check if I was blessed 'cause you knew I was low
Head gone, rollin' off the throne
I remember, I remember, we was in the park
Late night, made love on the grass
Got my head in the clouds, countin' all my stars
In my ears, said the world was ours
Went to hell and back just to heal my wounds
'Cause it gets like that, wrong side of the moon
No Tutankhamun, you're my Cleopatra
No side thing, don't need a backup
Need a real one, don't need an actor
I lost once, they think you won a BAFTA
Come and be my girl

[Chorus]
Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was on me

[Outro]
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Just like we say)
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Just like we say)
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah (Just like we say)
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And would you be my Yellow, girl?
