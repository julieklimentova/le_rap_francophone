(Aye... yeah)
(Yeah yeah...)
(Its Savage in this build yea...)

[Verse 1]
Smoking hella dope to hide the fuckin depression
Popping xan after xan, and take away all the stress
Never less, if you want to talk to me, make a request
More or less, add some more zeros to my check
Is it here, whats the deal, I'ma beat em to the next
Fucking with yo bitch, man she wet up in the vet
Diamonds man they dripping, man, glistening on my neck
Yeah its Bamsavage, I ain't afraid to spit the TEC
Cheated on my bitch to see if pain still exist
I ain't mean to hurt you, I ain't think you slit yo wrists
All this fucking fame, all these hoes I can't resist
All these fucking drugs got me walking with a limp
If you take me back girl, I promise I'ma quit
If you take me back then I promise I'ma stop
Just tell me you love me, I promise I'll stop
Don't take me back and then I'm back on the block
Back on the block
Running from cops
Fuck any bitches, I'm getting that top
Know I'm the devil, so my block is hot
I think you an angel, sometimes I think not
You got some issues, I think you a thot
I'm gonna get rich and then stack up this guap
You see me Bam bitch, I grind on the spot

[Interlude]
(Shit...)
(Fuck it...)

[Verse 2]
Now sitting, reminiscing, talking, kissing
I was different, got me tripping
So I'm missing, my head spinning
I'm convinced, my forgiving in this love
Its a mission, in addition
Fix your heart, like its an issue
Yo know its Bam yeah
I from the molly, I rock the xan yeah
Fuck any bitches, I blame [?]
Yeah its Bam, I am the man yeah

[Outro]
Higher...
It's all you (aye)
It's all you (aye)
It's all you (yeah)
It's all you (aye)
It's on you
It's on you (it's on you)
It's on you (it's on you)
It's on you (it's on you)
