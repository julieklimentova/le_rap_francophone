Stick, hoo
Stick
God, hoo
Ayy

[Verse]
Ayy, today is the day with a life full of hate
Look at my face, all you see is disgrace
Come to my place and you'll fuckin' relate
Livin' this life, ain't no piece of the cake
Life is too fast to be slow in the race
They killin' us slowly, they takin' our place
Open your eyes and just have a lil' faith
Pause, crazy how the world's into sins
Just so any rich, but innocence is not making sense
They got me fuckin' mad
They puttin' chemicals up in the fuckin' meat to fuck us up
Better grab the condom to shoot the gun
Got me sick in every city
You know I'm with a burner, yeah, you know I hold a glizzy (Ayy)
Green dot style, yeah, I hold a fifty
Shoot him dead, now you gone, poof, like a gypsy
I heard you sayin' send seven shots, then you miss me
When the cops pulled me over, threw the pack out like a Frisbee
I can call my ex, I can fuck her but it's risky
Diamonds on my neck and so you know these diamonds drippy
Drippy, I fucked your ho on a six-speed
I fucked that bitch and she tipsy
Blue hundreds and my skin is ill, crispy
Real drip, nigga, no Zumies
I spent a hundred on Louis
Lil' bitch give me head in the Ksubi
You know that she want all my jewelry (Hoo, ayy)
Ayy, today is the day with a life full of hate
Look at my face, all you see is disgrace
Come to my place and you'll fuckin' relate
Livin' this life, ain't no piece of the cake
Life is too fast to be slow in the race
They killin' us slowly, they takin' our place
Open your eyes and just have a lil' faith
Pause, crazy how the world's into sins
Just so any rich, but innocence is not making sense
They got me fuckin' mad
They puttin' chemicals up in the fuckin' meat to fuck us up
Better grab the condom to shoot the gun
Got me sick in every city
You know I'm with a burner, yeah, you know I hold a glizzy
Green dot style, yeah, I hold a fifty
Shoot him dead, now you gone, poof, like a gypsy
I heard you sayin' send seven shots, then you miss me
When the cops pulled me over, threw the pack out like a Frisbee
I can call my ex, I can fuck her but it's risky
Diamonds on my neck and so you know these diamonds drippy
Drippy, I fucked your ho on a six-speed
I fucked that bitch and she tipsy

[Outro]
Motherfuckin' end, mmh-mmh
You think that's enough?
