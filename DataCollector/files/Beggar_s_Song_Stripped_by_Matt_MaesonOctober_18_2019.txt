          
            
            [Verse 1]
Jesus, come talk to me
I am but a blind mess, I am wild and free
I know that I need us more than I need me
One more whiskey, I am wild and free

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'm a beat-down, washed-up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'ma be damned if I let it keep me down
Oh yeah, I'm a beat-down, washed-up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'ma be damned if I let it keep me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, my mother Mary, come walk with me
I am on four drugs, I am wild and free
I know that I failed less, the less I knew me
Wander through the darkness, and come walk with me

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I'm a beat-down, washed-up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'ma be damned if I let it keep me down, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm a beat-down, washed-up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'ma be damned if I let it keep me down, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Won't you come on out? Yeah, yeah
You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Won't you come on out? Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We sing a beat-down, washed-up beggar's song
And we sing it even louder when the money is gone
Because we'll be damned if we let it keep us down, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm a beat-down, washed-up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'ma be damned if I let it keep me down, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Won't you come on out? Yeah, yeah
You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Won't you come on out? Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We sing a beat-down, washed-up beggar's song
And we sing it even louder when the money is gone
Because we'll be damned if we let it keep us down, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm a beat-down, washed-up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'ma be damned if I let it keep me down
