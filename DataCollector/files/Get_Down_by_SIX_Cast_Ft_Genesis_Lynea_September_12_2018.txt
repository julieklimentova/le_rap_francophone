Sittin’ here all alone, on a throne
In a palace that I happen to own
Bring me some pheasant, keep it on the bone
Fill my goblet up to the brim, sippin’ on mead
And I spill it on my dress with the gold lace trim
Not very prim and proper
Can’t make me stop
I wanna go hunting, any takers?
I’m not fake ‘cause I’ve got acres and acres
Paid for with my own riches
Where my hounds at? Release the bitches

[ENSEMBLE, spoken]
Woof

[ANNA OF CLEVES]
Everyday, head back for a round of croquet, yeah
‘Cause I’m a player
And tomorrow, I’ll hit replay

You, you said that I tricked ya (Tricked ya)
‘Cause I, I didn’t look like my profile picture
Too, too bad I don’t agree
So I’m gonna hang it up for everyone to see
And you can’t stop me ‘cause
I’m the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down
‘Cause I’m the queen of the castle

When I get bored, I go to court
Pull up outside in my carriage, don’t got no marriage
So I have a little flirt with the footman
As he takes my fur
As you were
Making my way to the dance floor
Some boys make an advance, I ignore them
‘Cause my jam comes on the lute, lookin' cute
Das ist gut
All eyes on me, no criticism
I look more rad than Lutheranism
Dance so hard that I’m causin’ a sensation
Okay ladies, let’s get in reformation

You, you said that I tricked ya (Tricked ya)
‘Cause I, I didn’t look like my profile picture
Too, too bad I don’t agree
So I’m gonna hang it up for everyone to see
And you can’t stop me ‘cause
I’m the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down (You dirty rascal)
Get down
Get down
‘Cause I’m the queen of the castle

Now I ain’t sayin’ I’m a gold digger
But check my prenup and go figure
Got gold chains
Symbolic of my faith to the higher power
In the fast lane
My horses can trot up to twelve miles an hour
Let me explain
I’m a Wienerschnitzel, not an English flower
No one tells me I need a rich man
Doin’ my thing in my palace in Richmond

You, you said that I tricked ya (Tricked ya)
‘Cause I (I), I didn’t look like my profile picture (No, no)
Too, too bad I don’t agree (Too bad I don’t agree)
So I’m gonna hang it up (Hang it up, hang it up) for everyone to see
And you can’t stop, you can’t stop me ‘cause
I’m the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down (Yeah, c’mon, ha!)
G-g-g-g-g-g-g-get down (Get down with me)
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down (This is Anna of Cleves, aha-ha-ha, get)
Get down (Ow!)
‘Cause I’m the queen of the castle
